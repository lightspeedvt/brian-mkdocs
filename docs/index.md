#The LSVT Hierarchy

This introduction briefly explains how the LSVT hierarchy works within the Application, and uses the analogy of a building to help explain how it all fits together.

A “building” is like a “System.”<br />
A “floor” is like a “Private Labeled Theme.”<br />
A “room” is like a “Location.”<br />
A “person” in a room, is like a “User.”<br />

Each VT Customer that has an Account with LightSpeed VT will have a “System” created. Think of a System like having a large office building built for you. The building has obvious attributes about it, like the name of the building, the general design, the paint job, etc.

Within the building, each floor may have some attributes that can be slightly different than the building. Things like; the interior design, the color of the carpet, the layout of the floor, the number of rooms, the room types, etc.

On each floor there are rooms, and ultimately that is where the people are... they are in the rooms. Each room may also have some unique things about it that may be slightly different than the floor it is on too. Things like; the channels that are subscribed to on the TV network in the room, the size of the room, the logo on the door of the room, etc.

Each person in the room will also be slightly different too. They may have different color shirts on and may have different preferences of what they do within the room, but they are only inside one room at a time.

All of that being said, there are some attributes that are part of the building, that are the same on every floor, such as; the elevator and the roof. Then there are things on each floor that won’t change per room, such as the carpet in the halls.

As you go through the Help Docs, you will see notes about certain things that are “System” specific, some that are “Theme” specific, some that are “Location” specific and some that are “User” specific. In some instances there are settings at one level that may override the level above it, so it is helpful to understand this hierarchy of how these settings work to really leverage the flexibility of what you can accomplish easily.
