#Initial Build and Artwork Design
This section will cover each step in the process of creating a Topic, Category, Course, Chapter, and Test question.

Even though the Topics menu is first in line, we're going to start with Categories. We'll explain more on that later.

##1. Categories Overview

To get started, navigate to Manage Content under the Super User Dashboard, **400 - Application Administration**, and then **402 - Content Management.** You will see a screen that looks like this:
		
<img src="/img/content_mgmt.png"/>

----

###Create new Category

From this screen you can either **Search** for an existing category, or **Create a new category**. We're going to click on **Create a new category.**

On this screen we can modify the following fields:

<img src="/img/create_new_cat1.png"/ alt="Click to open this in a new tab">

1. **Name**
	- Enter the name of the category here.
2. **Copied From**
	- This field will be populated automatically if you created this category using the "Copy" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.
3. **Description**
	- Enter the description of the category. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.
4. **Internal Description**
	- Enter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a course belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.
5. **Thumb Nail Image Path**
	- Enter the path to the category image (we cover this later _here_.)
6. **Rank**
	- The Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the _higher_ the category will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.
7. **Active Yes/No**
	- Select whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select "Yes" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that _here_.)
8. **Rollover Image URL**
	- Enter the path to the category rollover image (we cover this later _here_.)
9. **Pre-composed Yes/No**
	- The default setting here is usually "No". The "No" setting will automatically add a highlight/rollover effect to the category tile. If you set this to "Yes", it will remove that effect.

Example:

	Pre-Composed: No
	Pre-Composed: Yes
