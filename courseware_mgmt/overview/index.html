                <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This article is a “quick” overview on how the whole “Courseware Management” area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal “step-by-step” walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you’ll be able to follow along much more clearly.</p>
<p>When your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is “contained” and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users underneath it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">
        Note
    </p>
    <p class="last">
“Courses” are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with “Content Roles” - “Locations” and “Users.”
    </p>
</div>

<p><img alt="Image" src="../../img/content-container.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload your videos into the Video Library</strong><br />
The Video Library will let you upload any format of “source” video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Video Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Assemble your videos into Courses</strong><br />
Once you have one or more videos in the Video Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right “in-line” while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Video Library first). These videos will also be added to the Video Library for you automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add your courses to Content Roles</strong><br />
So far we have talked about “Videos” and “Courses” ... and now on to “Content Roles” ... all of these things are part of your “Content Container” as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire “Content Container.” Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have “Courses” within them. You can have “1” Course in a Content Role, or “1,000,000,000.” You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have these Content Roles:<br />
Sales Strategies - (this has courses on sales training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)<br />
Compliance - (this has courses on mandatory compliance training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)<br />
Front Desk Training - (this has courses on how to run the front desk) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)<br /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make Courses “Active” at each desired Location</strong><br />
All of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired</strong><br />
The list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are “Active” at their Location.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the “Location stuff.” For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being “Inactive” and they are grayed out. You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a Content Role called “Compliance” and you have two different courses in it, one is “Compliance Laws” and a separate, but similar course is “Compliance Laws for California” (for some reason California seems to have way more laws about Compliance than anywhere else).</p>
<p>You can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called “Compliance” - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of “Compliance.” However, you can Activate the “California” Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.</p>
<p>This flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">
        Note
    </p>
    <p class="last">
There is a way to make some Content Roles “Premium” so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the “in-depth” area of these Help Docs.

<p>So, that is the “quick” overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
<p>This section will help you create a new Category. A category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Example of the Training Center before you hover over a category tile with your cursor</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Example of a cursor rolling over the center Category</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../../img/rollover_2.png"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After you have selected your content container, you can select <strong>Category List</strong>, where you can either <strong>Search</strong> for an existing category, or <strong>Create a new category</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="create-or-edit-a-category-basic-info"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Create or Edit a Category - Basic Info</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Active Yes/No</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>Select whether this category should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select "Yes" here - this content will not be on display for anyone until you complete the very last step of the activation process.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rank</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: 1, Required Field</em></span><ul>
<li>The Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The <em>lower</em> the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the <em>higher</em> the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Category Type</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Standard or List of Links</em></span><ul>
<li>A category can be "Standard" or it can be a "List of Links". A "List of Links" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. You may use the "List of Links" Category Type to add additional organization layers to your Training Center. "Standard" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Required Field</em></span><ul>
<li>Enter the name of the category here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnail</strong><ul>
<li>Here you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnail Roll Over (Optional)</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>This can be left blank</em></span><ul>
<li>Here you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Add Sheen to Thumbnail</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>The "Yes" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to "No", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Add Sheen = Yes</th>
<th>Add Sheen = No</th>
<th>Charlie Sheen = Winning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="../../img/pre-composed-no.png"></td>
<td><img src="../../img/pre-composed-yes.png"></td>

        Warning - File Size Best Practices
    </p>
    <p class="last">
LSVT does not compress or resize your images. Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep the file size low, and use the correct dimentions, when uploading these thumbnails. For example, if you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.

If you recall from the diagram at the top of this section, the final step will be to activate this course for the Location. </em>Note 2: LightSpeed VT will create you an "Admin - All Content" role initially for testing and review purposes, however if you need to add additional roles, you may do so now, or after your Courseware is created. To add more Content Roles now, click on "Content Containers" in the top navigation bar now. We cover Content Containers and Roles in the <a href="../../content_containers/overview/">Content Containers</a> section of these Help Docs.</li>

<h2 id="chapters">Chapters</h2>
<p>Once a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.</p>
<p>A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part consists of either an M3U8 Playlist (for Streaming content) or an MP4 file (for Progressive).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Chapter may consist of:</strong><ul>
<li>Training parts and a Chapter test.</li>
<li>Training parts and no test.</li>
<li>No training parts and only a test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, a chapter with a test is followed by a "Recap". A "Recap" will play if the user fails to pass the test. This is optional, howevever it is recommended you include these. (In some scenarios, if you have a 10 minute chapter, and the user fails the test, it is a better user experience to have the user review a brief recap, 1-2 minutes, rather than go through the entire 10 minute video again)</p>
<p>Chapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only <strong>"Create New Chapter"</strong> from an existing <strong><em>course</em></strong>. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a <strong>"Create New Chapter"</strong> button at the top.</p>
<p>Click on that when you're ready to create your chapter.</p>
<h3 id="create-new-chapter-basic-info"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Create New Chapter - Basic Info</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Create New Chapter</strong> menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):</p>
<p>Create your chapter by filling out these fields:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Active</strong><ul>
<li>If this is a standard chapter, you must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rank</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: 1</em></span><ul>
<li>The Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the <em>higher</em> the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chapter Name</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the name of the chapter here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chapter Type:</strong><ol>
<li>Standard (Video and Test)</li>
<li>Test Only</li>
<li>Video Only (with Auto Advance)</li>
<li>Video Only (with Summary)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a closer look at these chapter types.</p>
<h2 id="adding-videos-to-your-video-library">Adding Videos to your Video Library</h2>
<h3 id="1-standard-video-and-test">1. Standard (Video and Test)</h3>
<p>In a Standard chapter type, the chapter must have at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.</p>
<p>After selecting 'Standard', you will need to click on 'Add Chapter Part' and either upload a new video to your <strong>Video Library</strong>, or copy and paste the path of an existing video in your <strong>Video Library</strong> into the chapter part field. </p>

<li>Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: <br /><br /><span style="color:red">This chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your “Report Card.” Click START below when you are ready.</span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)</strong><ul>

<li>Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that <strong>"pool"</strong> of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.</li>
<li>Note: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Test Pass Percentage</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: 100</em></span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pull Questions in Order By Rank</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: No</em></span><ul>
<li>This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fail Test on Incorrect</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: No</em></span><ul>
<li>Setting this to "Yes" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Answer Notifications</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: No</em></span><ul>
<li>Setting this to "Yes" will allow you to enter an email address <strong><em>per answer</em></strong> which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Test Stats</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Test Summary Nav Buttons</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have filled out each field, hit <strong>Save</strong>. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.</p>
<h3 id="create-new-chapter-part-2">Create New Chapter - Part 2</h3>
<p><a href="../../img/content_mgmt.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/placeholder.png"/></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Show Captions</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Leave blank for now.</em></span><ul>
<li>Selecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Video Path</strong>: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)<ul>
<li>For a default video for a "LaFR" we use: <span style="color:red">http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4</span> - this is a path to a placeholder "Coming Soon" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Path</strong>: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. <span style="color:red">Leave Blank for now.</span></li>
<li><strong>Asset Path</strong>: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank. <span style="color:red">Leave blank for now.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rehash/Recap - Video Path</strong><ul>
<li>A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a <em>recap</em> before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Add Question</strong> - <span style="color:red">Be sure to hit "Save" before you hit "Add Question" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.</span><ul>
<li>This is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.</p>
<h2 id="test-questions">Test Questions</h2>
<h3 id="create-new-test-question">Create new Test Question</h3>
<p><a href="../../img/content_mgmt.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../img/placeholder.png"/></a></p>
<p>After your chapter has been saved, click on <strong>"Add Question"</strong> and follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Question</strong><ul>
<li>This is where you enter the question text. For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: <span style="color:red">Did you understand everything in this chapter?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question Active</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>This is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question Rank</strong><ul>
<li>This field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle <strong>"Pull Questions in Order by Rank"</strong> is set to <strong>"Yes"</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Answer A) &amp; B)</strong><ul>
<li>This field is for the first possible test question answer. For this exercise enter this as the answer: <span style="color:red">Yes</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Correct / Inc.</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Checked</em></span><ul>
<li>These checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the <strong>"Correct"</strong> and <strong>"Incorrect"</strong> dialogue pop-ups will not be active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Response Action</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: None</em></span><ul>
<li>This drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the <strong>Response Info</strong> field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the <strong>Response Info</strong> field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Response Info</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Leave blank for now.</em></span><ul>
<li>This field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Points</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Leave blank for now.</em></span><ul>
<li>You can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a "Leaderboard" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Correct Answer</strong><ul>
<li>Here you can select "Any / All Correct", or any individual answer. If you hold <strong>Ctrl/Command</strong> you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer "A".</li>

<p>Once all of the fields are complete, hit <strong>"Save"</strong> and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.</p>
<p>And that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.</p>
