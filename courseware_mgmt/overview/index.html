<p>This article is an overview on how the “Courseware Management” area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal “step-by-step” walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you’ll be able to follow along much more clearly.</p>
<p>When your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is “contained” and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users within it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">
        Note
    </p>
    <p class="last">
“Courses” are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with “Content Roles” - “Locations” and “Users.”
    </p>
</div>

<p><img alt="Image" src="../../img/content-container.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload your videos into the Media Library</strong><br />
The Media Library will let you upload any format of “source” video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Media Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Assemble your videos into Courses</strong><br />
Once you have one or more videos in the Media Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right “in-line” while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Media Library first). These videos will also be added to the Media Library for you automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add your courses to Content Roles</strong><br />
So far we have talked about “Videos” and “Courses” ... and now on to “Content Roles” ... all of these things are part of your “Content Container” as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire “Content Container.” Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have “Courses” within them. You can have “1” Course in a Content Role, or “1,000,000,000.” You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you set up your content like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Content Role</th>
<th>Content</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sales Strategies</td>
<td>This has courses on Sales training AND New Hire Orientation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compliance</td>
<td>This has courses on mandatory Compliance training AND New Hire Orientation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Front Desk Training</td>
<td>This has courses on How To Run the Front Desk AND New Hire Orientation</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can see from this example that all 3 roles have their own unique content, as well as sharing the "New Hire Orientation" content. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make Courses “Active” at each desired Location</strong><br />
All of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired</strong><br />
The list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are Active at their Location.</p>
<p>In the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the “Location stuff.” For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being inactive and they are grayed out.</p>
<p>You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. </p>
<hr />
<p>Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a Content Role called “Compliance” and you have two different courses in it, one is “Compliance Laws” and a separate, but similar course is “Compliance Laws for California”</p>
<p>You can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called “Compliance” - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of “Compliance.” However, you can Activate the “California” Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.</p>
<p>Here is a visual representation of that example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Content Role Name</th>
<th>Courses in this Role</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compliance</td>
<td>Compliance, New Hire Orientation, AND California ONLY Compliance</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Regular Location Course Settings</th>
<th>Course Active?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compliance</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compliance - California Only</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>California Location Course Settings</th>
<th>Course Active?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compliance</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compliance - California Only</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this example, a user could have the Compliance content role, and still only see the content that they are assigned, because the course is not active at their location.</p>
<p>This flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">
        Note
    </p>
    <p class="last">
There is a way to make some Content Roles “Premium” so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the “in-depth” area of these Help Docs.
    </p>
</div>

<p>So, that is the “quick” overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="categories"><i class="fa fa-th-large" aria-hidden="true"></i> Categories</h2>
<p>This section will help you create a new Category. A category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Example of the Training Center before you hover over a category tile with your cursor</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="../../img/rollover_1.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Example of a cursor rolling over the center Category</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../../img/rollover_2.png"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this example, there are two images for the center Category. One thumbnail, and one rollover thumbnail.</p>
<p>Okay let's dive into Courseware Management - After you have selected your content container, you can either select <strong>Category List</strong>, where you can <strong>Search</strong> for an existing category, or <strong>Create a new category</strong>.</p>
<p>When you click on the <strong>Category List</strong> option, if you have any existing categories they will be displayed like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CatID</th>
<th>Rank</th>
<th>Category Name</th>
<th>Internal Desc.</th>
<th>Courses Assigned To</th>
<th>Active</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>This is a unique identifier for this Category.</td>
<td>This is order in which this category will display in the Training Center. (Lower the rank, higher it will display)</td>
<td>This is the name of the Category.</td>
<td>This is an area for internal notes only, the end-user will never see this text.</td>
<td>This is a list of Courses, with their Course ID, that are currently assigned to this Category.</td>
<td>If the Category is active, it will be checked.</td>
</tr>

<ol>
<li><strong>Active Yes/No</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>Select whether this category should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select "Yes" here - this content will not display for anyone until you complete the very last step of the activation process.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rank</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Auto Ranks</em></span><ul>
<li>The Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The <em>lower</em> the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the <em>higher</em> the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Category Type</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Standard or List of Links</em></span><ul>
<li>A category can be "Standard" or it can be a "List of Links". A "List of Links" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. You may use the "List of Links" Category Type to add additional organization layers to your Training Center. "Standard" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category. Please <a href="../../tc_hierarchy/overview/">CLICK HERE</a> to see more information about your Training Center Hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Category Name</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Required Field</em></span><ul>
<li>Enter the name of the category here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnail</strong><ul>
<li>Here you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device. After you have selected an image from your local device, and hit 'save', the thumbnail will appear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnail Roll Over (Optional)</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>This can be left blank</em></span><ul>
<li>Here you can enter the path to the category rollover image, OR choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Add Sheen to Thumbnail</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>The "Yes" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to "No", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>

LSVT does not compress or resize your images. Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep the file size low, and use the correct dimensions, when uploading these thumbnails.

<p>Once a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.</p>
<p>A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part consists of either an .m3u8 Playlist (for Adaptive Streaming) or an .mp4 file (for Progressive).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Chapter may consist of:</strong><ul>
<li>Training parts and a Chapter test.</li>
<li>Training parts and no test.</li>
<li>Only a test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A chapter with a test can be followed by a "Recap". A "Recap" can be text or video, that will play if the user fails to pass the test. This is optional, however it is recommended you include this for each chapter. (In some scenarios, if you have a 10 minute chapter, and the user fails the test, it is a better user experience to have the user review a brief recap, 1-2 minutes, rather than go through the entire 10 minute video again)</p>
<p>Chapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only <strong>"Create New Chapter"</strong> while editing an existing <strong><em>course</em></strong>. The "Chapters" section will become active after you have saved and created your course.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question Rank</strong><ul>
<li>This field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle <strong>"Pull Questions in Order by Rank"</strong> is set to <strong>"Yes"</strong>. Otherwise it will still randomize all of your test questions even if a rank is displayed.</li>

<li><strong>Display Correct or Incorrect Answer Graphic</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Checked</em></span><ul>

<li>Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then the system will randomly select that number from that <strong>"pool"</strong> of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Pass Percentage</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: 100</em></span><ul>
<li>Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question Sort Order</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Random</em></span><ul>
<li>Randomize the questions: This will pull all of the test questions randomly.</li>
<li>Pull Questions in Order By Rank: This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fail Test on Incorrect</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: No</em></span><ul>
<li>Setting this to "Yes" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Test Stats</strong> - <span style="color:red"><em>Default: Yes</em></span><ul>
<li>This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recap</strong><ul>
<li>If you add a recap, and the user fails the test, then the user will be prompted to take the <em>recap</em> before taking the test again. If they then fail the test a second time, they will have to take the training from the beginning of the chapter again.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>In a Test Only chapter type, the chapter will have no video parts, and at least 1 test question.</p>
<p>You will see that once you change the Chapter Type, the screen changes slightly. You no longer have the option to add a video to this chapter - as it is a test only.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-video-only-with-auto-advance"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Chapter - Video only (With Auto Advance)</h2>
<p>In a Video Only chapter type, the chapter will only have a video part, and no Summary or Test Question options.</p>
<p>A chapter set to Auto Advance will automatically begin playing the next chapter once it is done. </p>

        Warning

    <p class="last">
Your final chapter of your course CAN NOT be set to this chapter type, or it will cause an error. The system will have nothing to auto advance to once the course is completed!

<h2 id="chapter-video-only-with-summary"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Chapter - Video only (With Summary)</h2>
<p>This is similar to the option above, however in this case you can add a Summary to give the user additional information, direct them to another area of the system, or to simply say congratulations before they move on to the next chapter.</p>
