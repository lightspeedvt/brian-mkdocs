            <div class="section">
              
                <p>Here are some basic volcabulary terms to familiarize yourself with:</p>
<p><strong>System</strong><br />
This is the fully functional “System” that is the granddaddy object that holds all of your Private Labeled Themes, and Locations and users as well as the key to your destiny. A “System” is what we configure A to Z for a client of LightSpeed VT.</p>
<p><strong>Private Labeled Theme</strong><br />
When a client of ours takes on a large customer that wants their system “Private Labeled,” this is how we will accommodate that. It has a series of branding abilities and settings that give you the flexibility to “Private Label” your System. (Note - every System has art least one “Theme” which is your default theme).</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong><br />
This is the organizational “unit” that holds end users.</p>
<p><strong>Content Container</strong><br />
This is where all of the Courseware Content is held. All of your Courses are here, and these can be used, and re-used across the entire System; which means, in any/all Private Label Themes and Locations.</p>
<p><strong>Video Library</strong><br />
This is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to upload and encode videos content that will be used in the Courseware Management toolset.</p>
<p><strong>Courseware Management</strong><br />
This is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to Add/Edit courseware.</p>
<p><strong>Content Role</strong><br />
This is how you organize your Courses to be privileged to Users. A Content Role is simply made up of a list of Courses, and when a user is set to a Content Role, they may be able to have access to the Courses within it (assumingly said Courses are “Active’ at their Location).</p>
<p><strong>Premium Content Role</strong><br />
This is simply a Content Role that is set to “Premium” and thus only available to specified “Super Users” or “Top Admins.” These are used for content that is reserved for premium needs and may be a premium purchase, therefore you do not want Location Managers turning this on for users on their own (as they need to purchase it). These “Premium Content Roles” can be set per-Location for further flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Super User Dashboard</strong><br />
This feature allows access to all of the multi-location administration and reporting tools.</p>
<p><strong>Main Menu</strong><br />
This is the first screen users are presented with upon successful sign in. This is springboard or “Main Menu” that has access to all of the features and areas of the System that users need, via the Carousel Panels, the System Modules and the Quicklinks, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Main Menu Message (Video)</strong><br />
This Main Menu Message is automatically displayed within the Main Menu upon an end-user’s first sign-in experience. This is typically used to introduce them to the VT System experience. Additionally, new Main Menu Messages can be inserted here for future communication needs, in which all users will see upon next signin. All users can replay the current Main Menu Message at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Main Menu Carousel Panels &amp; Carousel Panel Previews</strong><br />
These are the primary navigation panels, providing access and explanation to function that all users regularly use. On each carousel panel, there is an option for an approximate 30-second message that all users can click on and see. Use our default host or insert your own talent/host via custom videos.</p>
<p><strong>Main Menu Bulletin Board</strong><br />
Customizable text heading and greeting appearing at the top of the Main menu interface (administrable by location via location administrator &amp; Super Users).</p>
<p><strong>Left and Right Side Banner Graphics</strong><br />
Displays custom, location-specific artwork and messages on the Main Menu.</p>
<p><strong>My LightPad</strong><br />
User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong><br />
An open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword. We can also add a drop-down contextual menu to force desired search words/phrases. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>End User Click Agreement</strong><br />
LightSpeed VT offers the ability for you to have your end users go through a “Click Agreement” process upon first signin. The Click Agreement is a “Location” specific setting and is presented to the user upon first sign in and they must click “I AGREE” before it will allow them to proceed. This is a text-based agreement and needs to be provided to LSVT to be implemented at the desired locations (or all locations).</p>
<p><strong>APB – All Points Bulletin</strong><br />
A “splash screen” that users see to put some communication or messaging on. This can be; video based, image and/or text based. This prompt can be inserted either as soon as a user signs in, or as soon as they click “Training Center.” This is an optional screen and can be designated per location. There is also a toggle to indicate whether users can “click to now show this message again.” This feature is commonly used to announce actionable messages, as you can link to any other feature or screen to do a desired activity.</p>
<p><strong>My Report Card</strong><br />
A multi-level report for each user to see their own progress within the training content available to them. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score.</p>
<p><strong>My Usage Report</strong><br />
This is a usage report that provides a visual dashboard of activity, or lack thereof. It includes sign in activity and content usage and can be filtered in many ways, including by date range. (NOTE: The name of this report may be changed as desired.)</p>
<p><strong>My Profile</strong><br />
A screen where each user can edit their own profile (access to this can be toggled off per user as desired.)</p>
<p><strong>My Favorites</strong><br />
Quick access to a list of training Chapters that each user may have indicated as their favorites. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration. “Favorites &amp; Ratings” are tied together as one feature.)</p>
<p><strong>File Vault</strong><br />
A repository to place downloadable resources for each location. Location administrators and managers also have access to add resources to this File Vault for their location as desired. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>My Certifications</strong><br />
This is where users can see any “Certification” that are available to them. There may be more than one certification available to them at a time. A Certification can be assigned to an Access Level, and is made up of a set of courses. Once all of the courses are complete within a Certification, a printable certificate with the private label logo and colors is available for the user. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>My Billing Profile</strong><br />
If the Chargify subscription shopping cart is tied to a location, this is the button a user will click to alter their billing details, such as; update credit card information, upgrade/downgrade subscription, and cancel subscription. (NOTE: They “My Billing Profile” feature is disabled in the System configuration if Chargify is not utilized.)</p>
<p><strong>Calendar</strong><br />
This is a “To-Do” Calendar for end users to use. This first version of the Calendar is location centric, and unique per user. This means that the assignments and the viewing of the Calendar is at the “Location” level, not the Super User, or Multi-Location level in this version. Events can be added/updated a few different ways. Users can create events for anything they would like, such as: appointments, reminders, training task, etc. Admins/Managers can assign events to one or more users and can view calendars of Users to see if the events have been completed.</p>
<p><strong>My Notes</strong><br />
Notes are enabled on each chapter in the Training Center, which adds a “My Notes” tab on every video. This allows the users to click this tab, and it will expand a little note pad where they can take notes on each chapter as they follow along with the video. These notes can be reviewed at anytime by clicking “My Notes” from the System Modules on the Main Menu and all of the chapters that notes were taken on, will output here. These notes can be searched, printed and exported to a PDF as desired.</p>
<p><strong>Admin Quick Links Menu</strong><br />
This menu is visible only to Location Managers, Administrators and Super Users (it is hidden to standard users) and contains all of the buttons to access the features and reports that are needed to oversee and administrate the System.</p>
<p><strong>Report Cards</strong><br />
A multi-level report for managers to select desired users and view their progress within the training content available to each user at that location. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score. Results can all be exports to serve additional needs.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Report</strong><br />
This report is for managers to select desired users and a date range and view their history of usage including sign ins, content usage and pass/fail attempts. This is plotted against a date range with graphs to provide a visual of their activity or lack thereof. This report is a multi-level report allowing the manager/admin to click on the data and get a drilled down view of what makes up each of the summary numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Content Report</strong><br />
This is a multi-level report allowing a manager/admin to select a date range, and then any desired Category, Course and Chapters and view total usage on each piece of content, and also drill down to see the “attempted/pass/fail” data on each, and additionally click each of those numbers to reveal what users and dates comprise those summaries.</p>
<p><strong>Manage Users</strong><br />
This allows for the administration of all of the users at this location. It provides menus to create/edit users, as well as search for users based on some different filters and sorting criteria, as well as export these search results for additional needs.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Email Upon User Creation</strong><br />
This feature can email a notification to the user, that their username has been created. This is handy so that as Admins/Managers create users, those users are automatically notified that their account has been created.</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment</strong><br />
This allows Admins/Managers (who have the privilege to “Create Users”) to easily enroll users at their location. This feature allows the Admin/Manager to define what type of user they want to enroll, then there are two options on how to notify users: 1) the Admin/Manager can enter or upload a list of email addresses and the System will notify these users via email to complete their enrollment, or 2) the System will generate a unique URL/link that can be used in other ways, such as: email campaigns, printed on collateral, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Location Settings</strong><br />
Administration menu for location information. Settings include: Address Information, the Main Menu Bulletin Board, and Location Graphic Tiles/Side Banner.</p>
<p><strong>Watch Dogs</strong><br />
The Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where, in theory, a “watch dog” is placed at certain areas of the System and “barks” when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be configured per location as desired.</p>
<p><strong>Access Levels</strong><br />
This is what defines a user’s privileges, or “access/no access” to administrative features. Example: Manager vs. Standard User (this is a distinct set of levels that are defined later in this document).</p>
<p><strong>Content Roles</strong><br />
This designation defines what content is available to each user. A user can be a member of multiple “Content Roles” allowing for infinite flexibility for designating content to users.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong><br />
This allows for the administration of teams at each location. A team can be set up to organize users for reporting reasons. Once a team is created, it will appear on the user’s profile and each user can be assigned to a team. On the reports, there is then a filter for viewing by teams. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>Categories</strong><br />
Courses are organized into Categories in the Training Center Menu. Categories are controlled from the top level of the application and may be toggled on per location. If a Category is toggled off for a specific location, none of the users will be able to see any of the Courses that are inside that Category. Once a user clicks on a Category, a list of Courses is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Courses</strong><br />
A Course is made up of a series of Chapters, a Course description (in text), a Course thumbnail (picture or image representing the Course) and a Course Preview Trailer (video). You can decide if a user can take the Chapters in any order they choose, or if they are required to take them in order.</p>
<p><strong>Course Preview Trailer</strong><br />
A short video (approximately 30 seconds) that gives the user a brief explanation of what the course will cover.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter</strong><br />
Once a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter (Chapter module) of their choice (if they are not required to take the Chapters in order). When all Chapters in a Course are complete, the Course is then marked complete. A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter module may consist of up to multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of one of the following media types: video, Flash SWF, or PDF document. A Chapter may consist of training parts and a Chapter test; training parts and no test; or no training parts and only a test. A test may be followed by an optional “Recap” Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test.</p>
<p><strong>Playback Privileges</strong><br />
Fast-forward and the “skip” button are only available to top level location managers, administrators and Super Users by default. There is optional configuration to make additional access levels have these privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Captions</strong><br />
Closed Captions can be added to each Chapter, allowing users to toggle Captions on and off for their desired language. (NOTE: Content needs to be transcribed with time code and then also translated into a desired language.)</p>
<p><strong>Favorites and Ratings</strong><br />
The ability for a user to mark this Chapter as a Favorite, and also rate it on a scale of 1 to 5. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)</p>
<p><strong>Socialize</strong><br />
This feature provides the ability for your users to post to social networks, specifically Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin, after they complete interactive training Chapters.</p>
