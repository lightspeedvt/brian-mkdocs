The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Job Positions\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position.

On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Use New Category Layout\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nChanging this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Layout Column Count\n \n\n\nIf the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Share Settings\n\n\nThese are Social Share Settings...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Settings\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google Translation\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nGoogle Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Smartling Translation\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information on Language and System Localization can be found...\n\n\nEnrollment (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThis feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location. \n\n\n\n\nEnable Enrollment Options\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Link Text\n\n\nThis will be the button or link in the Enrollment email that the user will click on to proceed to a registration form to enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email\n\n\nThis will appear to the end user as the 'From' email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Subject\n\n\nEnter the Subject of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Top\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the top of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Bottom\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the bottom of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base \nHERE\n. \n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\nHere you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an admin attempts to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.\n\n\nThe Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.\n\n\nTypically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information. \n\n\nLightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThe LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)\n\n\nThere are two tiers to the LightPad. The first is a simple way for your end users to contact Support.\n\n\nThe second is a way for users to 'Ask the Expert' \n\n\n\n\nEnable LightPad Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn off or on the LightPad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad From Address\n\n\nThis field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LightPad Support Yes/No\n\n\nThis feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support Title\n\n\nThis is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Button Name\n \n\n\nThis is the name of the button users click to send a message to support. Example: Click Here for Help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Image\n \n\n\nEnter the path to the Image.

This text appears on the page where the user sends the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery Options\n\n\nThese settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System. \n\n\nOnce these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendgrid Subuser\n\n\nThis feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function. \n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages.

All of your \u201clocations\u201d are under the umbrella of your \u201csystem.\u201d At the system level is where the private label branding definitions are set, so all of \u201clocations\u201d within your system will inherit your branding attributes.  System Information   Exit URL  This is the URL to take the user to once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to your sign in page.      Content Containers  Here you can make updates to the content role and access level instruction screens.    Content Role and Access Level Instructions  Here you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:  Content Roles:  Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.  Access Levels:  Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time.         System Settings  Below are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.   Search Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the search feature.    Favorites Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the Favorites feature.

TC Layout Column Count    If the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.    Social Share Settings  These are Social Share Settings...     Language Settings   Enable Google Translation   Default: Yes  Google Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.    Enable Smartling Translation   Default: No  If utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.     More information on Language and System Localization can be found...  Enrollment (Updated Per Theme)  This feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location.    Enable Enrollment Options   Default: No  If this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.

The Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.  Typically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information.   LightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)  The LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)  There are two tiers to the LightPad. The first is a simple way for your end users to contact Support.  The second is a way for users to 'Ask the Expert'    Enable LightPad Yes/No   Default: Yes  This will turn off or on the LightPad    LightPad From Address  This field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.    Custom LightPad Support Yes/No  This feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.    LightPad Support Title  This is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!

Message Delivery Options  These settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System.   Once these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.  Once toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.  Adding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.  Once the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.   Message Delivery - LightPad   Default: Yes  This will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad.     Message Delivery - SMS   Default: No  This will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email.

The Course is the building block that is turned on in location for Content Roles that users are assigned to. A category will automatically appear for a user if there is a Course within that Category that the user has privileges to.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Summary Screen\n\nThis is the screen a user sees when they select a Course. This menu is slightly different if it is VT Courseware vs. SCORM courseware.\n\n\nLet's take a more detailed look.\n\n\n1. Categories\n\n\nA category is made up of courses, a description (in text), an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Category\n\n\nFrom this screen you can either \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n. For this lesson, click on \nCreate a new category.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Category\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCategory Basic Info\n\n\nCreate your category by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Type\n\n\nA category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\" - which means, you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, file to download, etc.\n\"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are within that category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n - *Required\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nHere you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail Rollover\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nHere you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen to Thumbnail\n\n\nThe default setting here is usually \"No\". The \"No\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"Yes\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Additional Information\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the description of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the internal description.

Chapter Overview\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from an existing \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top.\n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 1\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your chapter by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nYou must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\nNote: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nFor a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4\n - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. \nLeave Blank for now.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank. \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRehash/Recap - Video Path\n\n\nA recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a \nrecap\n before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Question\n - \nBe sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.\n\n\nThis is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.\n\n\n4. Test Questions (Quick) Overview\n\n\nThere are 4 main testing mechanisms, we'll only cover #1 in this section. More on test questions can be found in the \nContent Administrator\n section:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Choice\n\n\nDrag and Drop / Order\n\n\nMatching (Match a Term to a Definition)\n\n\nFill in the Blank\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Test Question\n\n\n\n\nAfter your chapter has been saved, click on \n\"Add Question\"\n and follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the question text. For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: \nDid you understand everything in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF File Path (Not Required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is named for some legacy test question content, and it is used presently for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF Data (not required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is similar to the one above - it is used for some legacy content and it is also used for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A) \n B)\n\n\nThis field is for the first possible test question answer. For this exercise enter this as the answer: \nYes\n\n\nIn the \nAnswer B)\n field, enter: \nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Correct / Inc.\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n dialogue pop-ups will not be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the \nResponse Info\n field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Info\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer\n\n\nHere you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold \nCtrl/Command\n you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the fields are complete, hit \n\"Save\"\n and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nAnd that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.\n\n\nNow, if your initial build calls for it, let's quickly cover the Topics menu. Topics are different from the rest because (as of 6/16/2015) there hasn't been an Admin menu created for it.\n\n\nSo let's dive right in...\n\n\n5. Topics\n\n\nThe topics menu in LightSpeed VT is a simple way to group categories together and display them in a condensed format. Remember - the reason we do this step last is because now you can add your list of Categories to your topic menu. Also please note that this step may be completely optional to your build - depending on the outline.\n\n\nFirst, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.\n\n\nAdd the Topic to the Database\n\n\nTo get started let's add the topic to the database. We do this from the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then click on \n408 - Use Topics\n\n\n\n\nOn this screen there are only 2 fields to worry about:\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nEnter the name of your topic - it needs to be lower case, and with no special characters or spaces. Example: \nABC Motors\n you might call it: \nabc_motors\n - and please note that this should match the topic XML File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML File\n\n\nThis name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word \n\"topics_\"\n and \n\".xml\"\n to the filename. For example, \nabc_motors\n will now be: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is now complete.\n\n\nCreate the Topic XML\n\n\nNow you're ready to create a topic XML. \nDownload a Sample \nHere\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate an existing topic XML\n\n\nDownload an existing topic XML to your desktop and rename it to the same filename you just entered in the previous step. Ours will be named: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n - Or download the sample XML file above and edit that one.\n\n\nTopics are stored in this folder on the lsvt-cloudfront server: lsvt-cloud-front/topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration via XML\n\n\n\n\nThe topics menu uses XML configuration files to specify settings. The following values are supported:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n - HTML formatted text that will be displayed over the topic icons. Note the usage of CDATA tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n![CDATA[\nb\nWelcome to... :\n/b\n Please select a topic library below.]]\n/title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n - Listing of topic nodes as well as listing how many columns to display this as. (typically we use 2, 3 or 4 columns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopics columns=\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n - Unique identifier (Typically we just increase this by 1 per topic)\n\n\nSRC\n - The web URL path to the tile to be displayed (typically a JPG or PNG)\n\n\nRollover\n - The web URL path to the tile to be displayed as the rollover image (typically a transparent PNG file)\n\n\nUrl\n - \n(Optional)\n - If the topic should link to anywhere other than the categories list you can add a URL path of where that topic should link to. (please this between the \"label\" and the \"description\" values)\n\n\nUrlTarget\n - \n(Optional)\n  - Include this after the URL value to indicate opening a new window (blank), same window (self), etc.\n\n\nLabel\n - This is the Topic name (displayed below the topic on the topic screen, as well as the cookie crumb once selected)\n\n\nDescription\n - \n(Optional)\n  - Topic description (displayed on the categories screen once a topic is selected)\n\n\nCategories\n - Comma delimited list of category ids for this topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic id=\n001\n src=\nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/top_image1.jpg\n rollover=\nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/topic_image2_rollover.png\n url=\nhttp://www.google.com\n urlTarget=\n_blank\n label=\nSales Training\n description=\n \n categories=\n3251,3201\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of what it looks like all put together:\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\n\ntitle\n![CDATA[\nb\nWelcome to... :\n/b\n Please select a topic library below.]]\n/title\n\n\n\ntopics columns=\n3\n\n\n\ntopic id=\n001\n src=\nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/top_image1.jpg\n rollover=\nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/topic_image2_rollover.png\n url=\nhttp://www.google.com\n urlTarget=\n_blank\n label=\nSales Training\n description=\n \n categories=\n3251,3201\n/\n\n\n\n/topics\n\n\n\n/data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen that is ready, upload it to the cloud under the \nlsvt-cloud-front/topics\n folder.\n\n\nUpdate the Carousel and Top Navigation links in the Themer\n\n\n5a. Legacy Themer\n\n\nLet's add your new topic XML file to the system now. We do that in the Themer. For the legacy themer, navigate to the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then click on \n403 - Manage Legacy Themes\n\n\n\n\nSelect Your Theme\n\n\nSelect the theme you are modifying from the drop-down menu. We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the Main Menu Coursel\n\n\nSelect the Main Menu tab at the top\n\n\nHover over the \"Select\" link to identify which carousel panel is currently linking to the Training Center, and click on the pencil/edit icon. The link will be something like: /v4/training_center.cfm, or /tc/\n\n\nOnce that menu appears, update the Link Url - you will want it to say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type=\nabc_motors\n (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the Top Nav bar\n\n\nClick on the Top Nav tab at the top of the screen and then click on the Pencil/Edit icon next to the \"Training Center\" menu link.\n\n\nModify that link the same way you did for the main menu, adding \"\n?type=abc_motors\"\n to the end of the url so it reads: \"/v4/training_center.cfm?type=abc_motors\" and then hit save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Important Note\n    \n\n    \n\nWhen you are done managing a theme, be sure to return to the \n\"Select Group\"\n tab and select LightSpeed VT - Mission Control. This will place you back at your home location group so you cannot accidentally overwrite any settings.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n5b. Themer T-1000\n\n\nLet's add your new topic using the new Themer. Navigate to the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then click on \n403 - Manage Themes\n\n\n\n\nSelect Your Theme\n\n\nSelect the group are modifying from the drop-down menu \n(1)\n, and then click on \n\"Edit Theme\"\n next to the group \n(2)\n (see screenshot below). We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar. Both of these can be found under the \n\"Components\"\n menu in the top nav area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the Main Menu Carousel\n\n\nSelect the Main Menu Carousel from the Components tab at the top\n\n\nClick on \n\"Edit\"\n next to the \n\"Training Center\"\n Carousel\n\n\n\n\nNow update the Link Url - you will need to add \n\"?type=abc_motors\"\n to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type=\nabc_motors\n (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the Top Nav bar\n\n\nSelect \n\"Menus\"\n from the Components tab at the top.\n\n\nFind the \n\"Top Nav Menu\"\n From the list of menus (usually it is the first one)\n\n\nClick on \n\"Edit\"\n next to the \n\"Training Center\"\n line\n\n\n\n\nNow update the Link Url - similar to what you just did on the Carousel - you will need to add \n\"?type=abc_motors\"\n to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type=\nabc_motors\n (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update. \nNote:\n This is a good example, where this link is currently pointing to \n/tc/\n - so you'll want to replace that link completely with the information above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow your theme is updated, let's move on to the next section... \nArtwork Design!",

Training Center  This is where users navigate \u2013 topically \u2013 through the available content, with Courses being the building blocks of the content that users have available to them to complete.   There are different types of Courses that the Training Center can display such as: VT Courseware, which is the LSVT format that inherently comes with your VT System; SCORM/, which is a standardized format which outside authoring tools can be utilized to build courses; or \u201ccustom\u201d where you may engage in a custom build of a Course type to accommodate a specific need.  Category Selection Menu  This is the top level of the navigation hierarchy and Course grouping.   Course Selection Menu  This is the second level of training center navigation. The Course is the building block that is turned on in location for Content Roles that users are assigned to. A category will automatically appear for a user if there is a Course within that Category that the user has privileges to.

On the  Create New Category  menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):   Category Basic Info  Create your category by filling out these fields:   Active Yes/No  Select whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process.

Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.    Category Type  A category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\" - which means, you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, file to download, etc.\n\"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are within that category.    Name  - *Required  Enter the name of the category here.    Thumbnail  Here you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.    Thumbnail Rollover  -  Can be left blank  Here you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.    Add Sheen to Thumbnail  The default setting here is usually \"No\". The \"No\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"Yes\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, etc.)     Category Additional Information   Description  -  Can be left blank  Enter the description of the category.    Internal Description  -  Can be left blank  Enter the internal description. This is an Internal view for you only.

            "text": "Once a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.  A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..   A Chapter may consist of:  Training parts and a Chapter test.  Training parts and no test.  No training parts and only a test.     By default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)  Chapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only  \"Create New Chapter\"  from an existing  course . So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a  \"Create New Chapter\"  button at the top.  Click on that when you're ready to create your chapter.   Create New Chapter - Part 1  On the  Create New Chapter  menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):   Create your chapter by filling out these fields:   Name  Enter the name of the chapter here.    Active  You must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.    Rank  The Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the  higher  the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.    Number of Test Questions  -  Default: 1  Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that  \"pool\"  of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.  Note: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.    Test Pass Percentage  -  Default: 100  Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.    Test Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)  Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is:  This chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.    Test Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)  Enter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.    Test Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)  Enter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.    Test Type  -  Default: Standard  Your options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found  here .    Pull Questions in Order By Rank  -  Default: No  This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.    Fail Test on Incorrect  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.    Answer Notifications  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address  per answer  which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.    Show Test Stats  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.    Show Test Summary Nav Buttons  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.    Enable Notes  -  Default: Yes  This will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should  always  be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.    Social  -  Leave blank for now.  You can enter in social information  per chapter .    Chapter Part Info  -  Default: 1  You must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.     Once you have filled out each field, hit  Save . After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.  Create New Chapter - Part 2    Show Captions  -  Leave blank for now.  Selecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.    Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path  Video Path : This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)  For a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use:  http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4  - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.    Mobile Path : This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.  Leave Blank for now.  Asset Path : This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank.  Leave blank for now.    Rehash/Recap - Video Path  A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a  recap  before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.    Add Question  -  Be sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.  This is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.     Once all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.",

Response Action  -  Default: None  This drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the  Response Info  field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the  Response Info  field.    Response Info  -  Leave blank for now.  This field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.    Points  -  Leave blank for now.  You can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.    Correct Answer  Here you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold  Ctrl/Command  you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".

Next Steps  And that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.  Now, if your initial build calls for it, let's quickly cover the Topics menu.

Remember - the reason we do this step last is because now you can add your list of Categories to your topic menu. Also please note that this step may be completely optional to your build - depending on the outline.  First, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.  Add the Topic to the Database  To get started let's add the topic to the database. We do this from the Super User Dashboard,  400 - Application Administration , and then click on  408 - Use Topics   On this screen there are only 2 fields to worry about:   Topic  Enter the name of your topic - it needs to be lower case, and with no special characters or spaces. Example:  ABC Motors  you might call it:  abc_motors  - and please note that this should match the topic XML File.    XML File  This name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word  \"topics_\"  and  \".xml\"  to the filename. For example,  abc_motors  will now be:  topics_abc_motors.xml  in this field.     This step is now complete.  Create the Topic XML  Now you're ready to create a topic XML.  Download a Sample  Here   Duplicate an existing topic XML  Download an existing topic XML to your desktop and rename it to the same filename you just entered in the previous step. Ours will be named:  topics_abc_motors.xml  - Or download the sample XML file above and edit that one.  Topics are stored in this folder on the lsvt-cloudfront server: lsvt-cloud-front/topics    Configuration via XML   The topics menu uses XML configuration files to specify settings. The following values are supported:   Title  - HTML formatted text that will be displayed over the topic icons. Note the usage of CDATA tags.        title ![CDATA[ b Welcome to... : /b  Please select a topic library below.]] /title      Topics  - Listing of topic nodes as well as listing how many columns to display this as. (typically we use 2, 3 or 4 columns)      topics columns= 3      ID  - Unique identifier (Typically we just increase this by 1 per topic)  SRC  - The web URL path to the tile to be displayed (typically a JPG or PNG)  Rollover  - The web URL path to the tile to be displayed as the rollover image (typically a transparent PNG file)  Url  -  (Optional)  - If the topic should link to anywhere other than the categories list you can add a URL path of where that topic should link to. (please this between the \"label\" and the \"description\" values)  UrlTarget  -  (Optional)   - Include this after the URL value to indicate opening a new window (blank), same window (self), etc.  Label  - This is the Topic name (displayed below the topic on the topic screen, as well as the cookie crumb once selected)  Description  -  (Optional)   - Topic description (displayed on the categories screen once a topic is selected)  Categories  - Comma delimited list of category ids for this topic      topic id= 001  src= http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/top_image1.jpg  rollover= http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/topic_image2_rollover.png  url= http://www.google.com  urlTarget= _blank  label= Sales Training  description=    categories= 3251,3201 /   Here is an example of what it looks like all put together:   data  title ![CDATA[ b Welcome to... : /b  Please select a topic library below.]] /title  topics columns= 3  topic id= 001  src= http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/top_image1.jpg  rollover= http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/topic_image2_rollover.png  url= http://www.google.com  urlTarget= _blank  label= Sales Training  description=    categories= 3251,3201 /  /topics  /data   When that is ready, upload it to the cloud under the  lsvt-cloud-front/topics  folder.
