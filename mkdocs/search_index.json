The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Job Positions\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position.

On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Use New Category Layout\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nChanging this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Layout Column Count\n \n\n\nIf the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Share Settings\n\n\nThese are Social Share Settings...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Settings\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google Translation\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nGoogle Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Smartling Translation\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information on Language and System Localization can be found...\n\n\nEnrollment (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThis feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location. \n\n\n\n\nEnable Enrollment Options\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Link Text\n\n\nThis will be the button or link in the Enrollment email that the user will click on to proceed to a registration form to enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email\n\n\nThis will appear to the end user as the 'From' email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Subject\n\n\nEnter the Subject of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Top\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the top of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Bottom\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the bottom of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base \nHERE\n. \n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\nHere you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an admin attempts to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.\n\n\nThe Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.\n\n\nTypically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information. \n\n\nLightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThe LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so.

You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support Title\n\n\nThis is the Title of the custom support message.

This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendgrid Subuser\n\n\nThis feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function. \n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be activated under System Settings, and configured per location as desired.\n\n\n\n\nWatchdog Enabled Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the Watchdog reporting feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Expectations Friendly Name\n \n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress Report Friendly Name\n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Tracker Friendly Name\n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Settings\n\n\nThis is an open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword.

            "text": "Welcome to 401 - Manage Systems.  Your organization is a \u201csystem\u201d within the VT Platform. All of your \u201clocations\u201d are under the umbrella of your \u201csystem.\u201d At the system level is where the private label branding definitions are set, so all of \u201clocations\u201d within your system will inherit your branding attributes.  System Information   Exit URL  This is the URL to take the user to once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to your sign in page.      Content Containers  Here you can make updates to the content role and access level instruction screens.    Content Role and Access Level Instructions  Here you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:  Content Roles:  Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.  Access Levels:  Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time.         System Settings  Below are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.   Search Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the search feature.    Favorites Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the Favorites feature.

Any newer system using Themer 2.0 will need to be renamed in there.    Show Teams  -  Default: Yes  When teams are ON, each  location  has their own ability to create their own teams. The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.  Use Teams Plus  - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found  HERE .    Show Job Positions  -  Default: No  This will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position. A Super User B with the \"Manage Systems\" privilege can manage the Job Positions. This setting is \"System Wide\" (not able to be different per location)    Enable Notes (HTML Training Center / Report in Search)   Default: Yes  This toggle will control the \"My Notes\" tab that shows up on the left side of the video player in the Training Center.    Calendar Enabled   Default: Yes  On legacy systems, this turns on automatically in the System Modules on the Main Menu. On newer systems, the System Design team must manually add the button to the Theme. This is a System wide setting.    Google Analytics Account ID  This is an account number specifically for you. It allows you to utilize Google Analytics to track usage around your system.    TC Home Icon URL (Legacy)  Use this to override the HOME icon URL in the Training Center. Example: /tc/#/trainingcenter/topics/acme_main - this is a Legacy setting. On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.    TC Use New Category Layout   Default: No  Changing this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.    TC Layout Column Count    If the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.    Social Share Settings  These are Social Share Settings...     Language Settings   Enable Google Translation   Default: Yes  Google Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.    Enable Smartling Translation   Default: No  If utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.     More information on Language and System Localization can be found...  Enrollment (Updated Per Theme)  This feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location.    Enable Enrollment Options   Default: No  If this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.    Enrollment Link Text  This will be the button or link in the Enrollment email that the user will click on to proceed to a registration form to enroll.

Location Settings  Here you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an admin attempts to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.  The Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.  Typically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information.   LightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)  The LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)  There are two tiers to the LightPad. The first is a simple way for your end users to contact Support.  The second is a way for users to 'Ask the Expert'    Enable LightPad Yes/No   Default: Yes  This will turn off or on the LightPad    LightPad From Address  This field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.    Custom LightPad Support Yes/No  This feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.    LightPad Support Title  This is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!

Message Delivery Options  These settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System.   Once these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.  Once toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.  Adding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.  Once the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.

Pass Back URL Settings  The pass back feature is an easy way to create a seamless experience for your users between LSVT and your application or to make easy to collect basic data about a user without the need to use our full ADMIN API.  There are a fixed number of optional parameters, or data elements about a user that LSVT can pass back to you via URL parameters. This could be used to allow a user to be passed back to your site and/or application \u2013 possibly already signed in, or to simply create a user in your system with the extra data provided.  We can quickly configure your system to pass these URL parameters of your choice, simply contact your project manager to get you in touch with System Config. Dept. to accomplish this.  Additional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base  HERE .
