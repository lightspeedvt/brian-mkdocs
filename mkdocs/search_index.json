            "text": "Courseware Management\n\n\nThis section will cover the steps for creating Categories, Courses, Chapters and Test questions for Your VT System. \n\n\nHere are some basic volcabulary terms to familiarize yourself with:\n\n\nTraining Center:\n This is where users navigate \u2013 topically \u2013 through the available content, with Courses being the building blocks of the content that users have available to them to complete.\n\n\nThere are different types of Courses that the Training Center can display such as: VT Courseware, which is the LSVT format that inherently comes with your VT System; SCORM, which is a standardized format which outside authoring tools can be utilized to build courses; or \u201ccustom\u201d where you may engage in a custom build of a Course type to accommodate a specific need.\n\n\nCategory Selection Menu\n: This is the top level of the navigation hierarchy and Course grouping.\n\n\nCourse Selection Menu\n: This is the second level of training center navigation. The Course is the building block that is turned on in location for Content Roles that users are assigned to. A category will automatically appear for a user if there is a Course within that Category that the user has privileges to.\n\n\nCourse Summary Screen (Chapter Menu)\n:  This is the screen a user sees when they select a Course. This menu is slightly different if it is VT Courseware vs. SCORM courseware.\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nA category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).\n\n\n Create a new Category\n\n\nFrom this screen you can either \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Category\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\nCategory Basic Info\n\n\nCreate your category by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not be on display for anyone until you complete the very last step of this process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Type\n - \nStandard or List of Links\n\n\nA category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\". A \"List of Links\" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. \"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n - \nRequired Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nHere you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail Rollover\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nHere you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen to Thumbnail\n\n\nThe default setting here is usually \"Yes\". The \"Yes\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"No\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen = Yes\n\n\nAdd Sheen = No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nFile Size best practices: Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep in mind file size when uploading image thumbnails. Currently LightSpeed VT does not compress any files when you upload them. If you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Category Additional Information\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the description of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is an Internal view for you only. This can be used to add additional important details about the course, or even to log recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nA Course is made up of one or more Chapters, a text description, an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and a Course Preview Trailer (video).\n\n\n1. Create a Course - Basic Info\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Course\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\nCreate your course by filling out the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this course should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not be on display for anyone until you complete the very last step of this process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this course will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the course will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first course. Rank 999 = the very last course. If two or more courses are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nA \"Linked Course (Banner)\" indicates that this course will be used to link to another course, rather than linking to a set of chapters as a Standard course would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n - \nDefault: Required Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the course here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n - \nDefault: Required Field\n\n\nSelect which category this course should go in. (Note: Currently a course can only be in 1 category at a time.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nEnter the path to the course image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on your server. Or, you can click on \"Choose File\" to upload a thumbnail from your local device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview Video\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the path to the course video preview (If you do not have a course preview video, just leave this blank.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for the entire course. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Chapter level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n9.. \nCourse Description\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the description of the course. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Internal Description\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a course belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the name of the author of this material (Usually the client's name - but if it's a collaboration, enter the name of the System, ex. Patricia Fripp as an individual, or NCM OnDemand as a collaboration, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nThis field is for the duration, in minutes, of the course. (This feature is currently not in use.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Settings\n\n\n\n\nHide this Course from Reports\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will show/hide the course in reporting sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide this Course from Search\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will toggle the course from being searchable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Chapters in Order\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this toggle to \"Yes\" will force the user to complete the chapters in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nAdd any keywords associated with this course. Type in your desired Keyword and then hit enter. Enter as many keywords as you desire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Info\n\n\n\n\nExtended Info\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. You can leave this empty for now - this is covered more in the Content Administrator section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role Assignments\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nChapters\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from an existing \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top.\n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 1, Basic Info\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\nCreate your chapter by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nIf this is a standard chapter, you must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Name\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Type:\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at these chapter types.\n\n\n1. Standard (Video and Test)\n\n\nIn a Standard chapter type, this is normal courseware - it has at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nAfter selecting 'Standard', you will need to click on 'Add Chapter Part' and add a path to your video file.\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\nNote: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nFor a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4\n - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. \nLeave Blank for now.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank. \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRehash/Recap - Video Path\n\n\nA recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a \nrecap\n before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Question\n - \nBe sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.\n\n\nThis is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.\n\n\nTest Questions\n\n\nCreate new Test Question\n\n\n\n\nAfter your chapter has been saved, click on \n\"Add Question\"\n and follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the question text. For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: \nDid you understand everything in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A) \n B)\n\n\nThis field is for the first possible test question answer. For this exercise enter this as the answer: \nYes\n\n\nIn the \nAnswer B)\n field, enter: \nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Correct / Inc.\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n dialogue pop-ups will not be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the \nResponse Info\n field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Info\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer\n\n\nHere you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold \nCtrl/Command\n you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the fields are complete, hit \n\"Save\"\n and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.\n\n\nNext Steps - Activation\n\n\nAnd that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.",

Category Type  -  Standard or List of Links  A category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\". A \"List of Links\" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. \"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category.    Name  -  Required Field  Enter the name of the category here.    Thumbnail  Here you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.    Thumbnail Rollover  -  Can be left blank  Here you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.    Add Sheen to Thumbnail  The default setting here is usually \"Yes\". The \"Yes\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"No\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)     Example:     Add Sheen = Yes  Add Sheen = No           \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \nFile Size best practices: Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep in mind file size when uploading image thumbnails. Currently LightSpeed VT does not compress any files when you upload them. If you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.\n       2.

Training parts and no test.  No training parts and only a test.     By default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)  Chapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only  \"Create New Chapter\"  from an existing  course . So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a  \"Create New Chapter\"  button at the top.  Click on that when you're ready to create your chapter.

Chapter Type:  Standard (Video and Test)  Test Only  Video Only (with Auto Advance)  Video Only (with Summary)     Let's take a closer look at these chapter types.  1. Standard (Video and Test)  In a Standard chapter type, this is normal courseware - it has at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.  After selecting 'Standard', you will need to click on 'Add Chapter Part' and add a path to your video file.   Test Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)  Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is:  This chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.    Test Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)  Enter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.     Test Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)   Enter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.     Number of Test Questions  -  Default: 1   Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that  \"pool\"  of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.  Note: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.     Test Pass Percentage  -  Default: 100   Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.     Test Type  -  Default: Standard   Your options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found  here .    Pull Questions in Order By Rank  -  Default: No  This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.    Fail Test on Incorrect  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.    Answer Notifications  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address  per answer  which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.    Show Test Stats  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.    Show Test Summary Nav Buttons  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.    Enable Notes  -  Default: Yes  This will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should  always  be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.    Social  -  Leave blank for now.  You can enter in social information  per chapter .    Chapter Part Info  -  Default: 1  You must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.     Once you have filled out each field, hit  Save .

Selecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.    Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path  Video Path : This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)  For a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use:  http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4  - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.    Mobile Path : This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.  Leave Blank for now.  Asset Path : This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank.  Leave blank for now.    Rehash/Recap - Video Path  A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a  recap  before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.    Add Question  -  Be sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.  This is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.

This field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.    Points  -  Leave blank for now.  You can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.    Correct Answer  Here you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold  Ctrl/Command  you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".

Auto Email Upon User Creation  This feature gives users who have access to 'Create User' to send an email to the user's email address with their login credentials, after they have been created.  Before updating these settings you will be asked which theme to modify. Select the theme from the drop down list and then you can edit the following fields:   Send Auto Email Upon User Creation   Default: No  If this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the email to work correctly. Note: Even if this is toggled \"yes\" you will still have the option to disable this when creating individual users if you choose.    From Email  This will appear to the end user as the 'From' email address.    Email Subject  Enter the subject of the email.    Email Body Top  Enter the copy that will go on the top of the email.    Email Body Bottom  Enter the copy that will go on the bottom of the email.     Note: You will be given a chance to preview this email during the user creation process.  Pass Back URL Settings  The pass back feature is an easy way to create a seamless experience for your users between LSVT and your application or to make easy to collect basic data about a user without the need to use our full ADMIN API.  There are a fixed number of optional parameters, or data elements about a user that LSVT can pass back to you via URL parameters. This could be used to allow a user to be passed back to your site and/or application \u2013 possibly already signed in, or to simply create a user in your system with the extra data provided.  We can quickly configure your system to pass these URL parameters of your choice, simply contact your project manager to get you in touch with System Config. Dept. to accomplish this.  Additional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base  HERE .   System Images  This feature allows you to set the default system images for all locations in your System.   Choose a file to upload  The image size should be 174x130 and either be a .PNG or .JPG    Image Link  (Optional)  You can add a link to the image, this may be used to link to a book for sale, or an upcoming webinar for example.    Text Area  (Optional)  Here you can write a short message to welcome the user. You can also personalize it using some optional TOKENS     Example:  Hello %Fname% %Lname%! Welcome to %LocationName%! Your username is: %UserName%  That would look like:  Hello Han Solo! Welcome to Rebel Command! Your username is: hsolo   Main Menu Welcome Message Config  On this screen you can add different welcome videos based on the user's access level or content role.  WebHooks Settings  This section will enable your system to start using webhooks. We'll explain this more in Phase 2.  Powered by Logo  Hide LSVT Logo?
