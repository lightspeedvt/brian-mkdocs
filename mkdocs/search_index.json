More advanced Configuration steps are covered in the \nContent Administrator\n section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nEven though in the LightSpeed heirarchy the Topics menu comes first, it is an optional componant, so we're going to start with Categories. This is explained in more detail in the Topics section.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n1. Categories Overview\n\n\nA category is made up of courses, a description (in text), an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image tile.\n\n\nTo get started, navigate to Manage Content under the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then \n402 - Content Management.\n You will see a screen that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Category\n\n\nFrom this screen you can either \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n. For this lesson, click on \nCreate a new category.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Category\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your category by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied From\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be populated automatically if you created this category using the \"Copy\" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEnter the description of the category. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a category belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumb Nail Image Path\n\n\nEnter the image path to the category image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on our cloud server. Because we did not build the image yet, put in a generic path as a placeholder: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/client_name/tiles/category_name.jpg\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that in the \nContent Containers / Activation\n section.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollover Image URL\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nEnter the path to the category rollover image - this is similar to the Thumb Nail Image Path above, where you can enter a generic path for now.\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-composed Yes/No\n\n\nThe default setting here is usually \"No\". The \"No\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"Yes\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (css, flash, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-composed = No\n\n\nPre-composed = Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nYou may ignore the \"VT2GO\" section here for now, we'll cover that in a later topic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Courses Overview\n\n\nA Course is made up of a series of Chapters, a description (in text), an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and a Course Preview Trailer (video).\n\n\nCreate new Course\n\n\nNow that your category is created, you can click on the \n\"Courses\"\n tab at the top of your screen, and then click on \n\"Create New Course\"\n.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Course\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your course by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the course here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied From\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be populated automatically if you created this course using the \"Copy\" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEnter the description of the course. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a course belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this course should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that in the \nContent Containers / Activation\n section.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Course - Reports\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will show/hide the course in reporting sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Course - Search\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will toggle the course from being searchable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for the entire course. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Chapter level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this course will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the course will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first course. Rank 999 = the very last course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is for the duration, in minutes, of the course. (This feature is currently not in use.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Chapters in Order\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this toggle to \"Yes\" will force the user to complete the chapters in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumb Nail Image Path\n\n\nEnter the path to the course image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on our cloud server. Because we did not build the image yet, put in a generic path as a placeholder: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/client_name/tiles/course_name.jpg\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview Path\n\n\nEnter the path to the course video preview (If this is your initial build, you likely do not have this video yet, so you can leave this path blank for the Content Admin to populate.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nEnter the name of the author of this material (Usually the client's name - but if it's a collaboration, enter the name of the System, ex. Patricia Fripp as an individual, or NCM OnDemand as a collaboration, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\nAdd any keywords associated with this course. These should be separated by a pipe \"|\" - ex. Sales|Selling|Closing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Assignment\n\n\nSelect which category this course should go in. For this exercise you will choose the category you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivileges\n\n\nYou can leave these access level privileges blank. These are for legacy clients that are not yet on Content Containers. However, if a group is NOT on content containers, then these access levels would be used (but this is rare - all new groups should be on content containers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. You can leave this empty for now - this is covered more in the Content Administrator section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout Fields\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. You can leave this empty for now - this is covered more in the Content Administrator section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nYou may ignore the \"VT2GO\" section here for now, we'll cover that in a later topic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Chapter Overview\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from an existing \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top.\n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 1\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your chapter by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nYou must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\nNote: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nFor a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4\n - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. \nLeave Blank for now.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank. \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRehash/Recap - Video Path\n\n\nA recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a \nrecap\n before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Question\n - \nBe sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.\n\n\nThis is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.\n\n\n4. Test Questions (Quick) Overview\n\n\nThere are 4 main testing mechanisms, we'll only cover #1 in this section. More on test questions can be found in the \nContent Administrator\n section:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Choice\n\n\nDrag and Drop / Order\n\n\nMatching (Match a Term to a Definition)\n\n\nFill in the Blank\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Test Question\n\n\n\n\nAfter your chapter has been saved, click on \n\"Add Question\"\n and follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the question text. For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: \nDid you understand everything in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF File Path (Not Required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is named for some legacy test question content, and it is used presently for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF Data (not required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is similar to the one above - it is used for some legacy content and it is also used for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A) \n B)\n\n\nThis field is for the first possible test question answer. For this exercise enter this as the answer: \nYes\n\n\nIn the \nAnswer B)\n field, enter: \nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Correct / Inc.\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n dialogue pop-ups will not be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the \nResponse Info\n field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Info\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer\n\n\nHere you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold \nCtrl/Command\n you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the fields are complete, hit \n\"Save\"\n and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nAnd that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.\n\n\nNow, if your initial build calls for it, let's quickly cover the Topics menu. Topics are different from the rest because (as of 6/16/2015) there hasn't been an Admin menu created for it.\n\n\nSo let's dive right in...\n\n\n5. Topics\n\n\nThe topics menu in LightSpeed VT is a simple way to group categories together and display them in a condensed format. Remember - the reason we do this step last is because now you can add your list of Categories to your topic menu. Also please note that this step may be completely optional to your build - depending on the outline.\n\n\nFirst, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.\n\n\nAdd the Topic to the Database\n\n\nTo get started let's add the topic to the database. We do this from the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then click on \n408 - Use Topics\n\n\n\n\nOn this screen there are only 2 fields to worry about:\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nEnter the name of your topic - it needs to be lower case, and with no special characters or spaces. Example: \nABC Motors\n you might call it: \nabc_motors\n - and please note that this should match the topic XML File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML File\n\n\nThis name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word \n\"topics_\"\n and \n\".xml\"\n to the filename. For example, \nabc_motors\n will now be: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is now complete.\n\n\nCreate the Topic XML\n\n\nNow you're ready to create a topic XML. \nDownload a Sample \nHere\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate an existing topic XML\n\n\nDownload an existing topic XML to your desktop and rename it to the same filename you just entered in the previous step. Ours will be named: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n - Or download the sample XML file above and edit that one.\n\n\nTopics are stored in this folder on the lsvt-cloudfront server: lsvt-cloud-front/topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration via XML\n\n\n\n\nThe topics menu uses XML configuration files to specify settings. The following values are supported:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n - HTML formatted text that will be displayed over the topic icons.

Active  You must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.    Rank  The Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the  higher  the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.    Number of Test Questions  -  Default: 1  Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that  \"pool\"  of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.  Note: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.    Test Pass Percentage  -  Default: 100  Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.    Test Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)  Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test.

Test Type  -  Default: Standard  Your options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found  here .    Pull Questions in Order By Rank  -  Default: No  This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.    Fail Test on Incorrect  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.    Answer Notifications  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address  per answer  which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.    Show Test Stats  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.    Show Test Summary Nav Buttons  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.    Enable Notes  -  Default: Yes  This will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should  always  be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.    Social  -  Leave blank for now.  You can enter in social information  per chapter .    Chapter Part Info  -  Default: 1  You must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.     Once you have filled out each field, hit  Save .

Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path  Video Path : This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)  For a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use:  http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4  - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.    Mobile Path : This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.  Leave Blank for now.  Asset Path : This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank.  Leave blank for now.    Rehash/Recap - Video Path  A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a  recap  before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.    Add Question  -  Be sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.  This is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.

First, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.  Add the Topic to the Database  To get started let's add the topic to the database.

XML File  This name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word  \"topics_\"  and  \".xml\"  to the filename.

For the legacy themer, navigate to the Super User Dashboard,  400 - Application Administration , and then click on  403 - Manage Legacy Themes   Select Your Theme  Select the theme you are modifying from the drop-down menu. We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar.    Update the Main Menu Coursel  Select the Main Menu tab at the top  Hover over the \"Select\" link to identify which carousel panel is currently linking to the Training Center, and click on the pencil/edit icon. The link will be something like: /v4/training_center.cfm, or /tc/  Once that menu appears, update the Link Url - you will want it to say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Save.    Update the Top Nav bar  Click on the Top Nav tab at the top of the screen and then click on the Pencil/Edit icon next to the \"Training Center\" menu link.  Modify that link the same way you did for the main menu, adding \" ?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the url so it reads: \"/v4/training_center.cfm?type=abc_motors\" and then hit save.     \n     \n        Important Note\n     \n     \nWhen you are done managing a theme, be sure to return to the  \"Select Group\"  tab and select LightSpeed VT - Mission Control.

We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar. Both of these can be found under the  \"Components\"  menu in the top nav area.     Update the Main Menu Carousel  Select the Main Menu Carousel from the Components tab at the top  Click on  \"Edit\"  next to the  \"Training Center\"  Carousel   Now update the Link Url - you will need to add  \"?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update.     Update the Top Nav bar  Select  \"Menus\"  from the Components tab at the top.  Find the  \"Top Nav Menu\"  From the list of menus (usually it is the first one)  Click on  \"Edit\"  next to the  \"Training Center\"  line   Now update the Link Url - similar to what you just did on the Carousel - you will need to add  \"?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update.  Note:  This is a good example, where this link is currently pointing to  /tc/  - so you'll want to replace that link completely with the information above.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nSystem Information\n\n\nThis section controls general system information.\n\n\nNote: We use the term \"Legacy\" for more than a few of these settings. Legacy means the toggle or setting only exists because OLD Systems may use the toggle, and that newer methods have been invented to update the toggle or setting. Anything marked Legacy will direct you where to go to update the setting in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Name\n\n\nThis is where we set the name of the System - you should never edit this (Accounting only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit URL\n\n\nThis is the URL to take the user to once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to the client's login page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Active Yes/No\n\n\nThis toggle will activate/deactivate the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Status\n\n\nChoose from: In Factory, Live, Preso (Presentation), or Internal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Description\n\n\nThis area is to briefly describe the System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Containers\n\n\n\n\nHere we can assign a system to a Content Container. This is how we keep the content isolated so that it is not possible (without severe human error) for content to cross over into unintended systems. It is possible for multiple systems to pull all from the same Container - but it is not possible for one system to pull from multiple Containers.\n\n\n\n\nUse Content Container Yes / No\n\n\nIf this system is not yet attached to a container, you will be given the option to create one for it. If this system is already attached to a container, you will be given the option to manage that container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto Populate Content Roles Yes / No\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nIt is possible to auto-populate content roles based on access levels. For example, if you want to ensure that when a \"Manager\" access level is assigned, you can auto-populate the desired Management Content Roles. This makes it easier to ensure each user is receiving the proper content when being created - either by a human or through the API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role and Access Level Instructions\n\n\nHere you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:\n\n\nContent Roles:\n Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.\n\n\nAccess Levels:\n Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Settings\n\n\nBelow are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.\n\n\n\n\nAllow SU B Extended Privileges\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis allows the SUPER USER B access level to be enabled to grant different system admin privileges. If this is YES, then each desired \"Super User B\" needs specifically to be touched to be set - it is not a \"carte blanche\" setting for SUBs at this system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the search feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorites Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Favorites feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Ratings feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Chapter Extras (TC Tubes)\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the \"tubes\" that appear below chapter titles in the training center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Vault Active / Friendly Name (Legacy)\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the File Vault. You can also rename the File Vault here for Legacy systems. Any newer system using Themer 2.0 will need to be renamed in there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Teams\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nWhen teams are ON, each location has their own ability to create their own teams. The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Job Positions\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position. A Super User B with the \"Manage Systems\" privilege can manage the Job Positions. This setting is \"System Wide\" (not able to be different per location)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow User Interests (Legacy)\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis is a feature that was partially built and not ready for use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Lock Username/Password\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis is a feature that is useful when there is another system integrated into LSVT, where the other system is controlling/creating usernames and passwords - such as NCM, and you want to have a Toggle on the user's profile where they cannot update/change the username or password. This is so it does not get out of sync with the integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTML Main Menu (Legacy)\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a toggle to switch between the main menu using Flash code or HTML code. This needs to be YES for all new clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Blue Steel (HTML Training Center) (Legacy)\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSimilar to the toggle above, this is a toggle to switch between using Flash or HTML. This needs to be YES for all new clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Boilerplate\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThe Boilerplate is the most basic component of the LSVT platform and represents the global UI of the system. It may help to think of it as the \"Page Template\" of the system. This toggle is controlled by the System Design team when they create the initial theme and will be set to YES for all new clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Main Menu 5000\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle goes hand-in-hand with the Boilerplate and Themer 2 - the System Design team will toggle this when they create the initial theme and it will be set to YES for all new clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Themer 2\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will enable the System to use the new Themer. As above, the System Design team will toggle this when they create the initial theme and it will be set to YES for all new clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes (HTML Training Center / Report in Search)\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will control the \"My Notes\" tab that shows up on the left side of the video player in the Training Center. There is also an over ride at the COURSE and CHAPTER level, in case a client has something like a \"Final Compliance Course\" where they do not want NOTES on that particular course or chapter available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Skip Video Disable\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nMobile devices by default can fast forward through content. Enabling this toggle will check the length of the chapter, say 5 minutes, and if the user completes the chapter before that 5 minute runtime, it will prevent them from moving forward to the test or next chapter, and they'll be forced to watch the chapter again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVMS Enabled (Legacy)\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis feature is in progress and not ready for LIVE yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalendar Enabled\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nOn legacy systems, this turns on automatically in the System Modules on the Main Menu. On newer systems, the System Design team must manually add the button to the Theme. This is a System wide setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics Account ID\n\n\nThis is an account number specifically for this client. It allows the client to utilize Google Analytics to track usage around their system. This is typically added by the System Design team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Home Icon URL (Legacy)\n\n\nUse this to override the HOME icon URL in the Training Center. Example: /tc/#/trainingcenter/topics/acme_main - this is a Legacy setting. On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Use New Category Layout\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nChanging this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Layout Column Count\n \n\n\nIf the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoilerplate Theme URL\n\n\nThis URL is added by the System Design team, it tells the System which CSS file to use for the Theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Settings\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google Translation\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nGoogle Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of our System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Smartling Translation\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf utilizing Smartling, then turn off \"Google Translation.\" Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few words to \"translate\" per System, depending on what buttons they may have renamed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information on Language and System Localization can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\nEnrollment\n\n\nAs a default, this is a System setting, however it can also be configured per Theme - so it is possible that many multiple Enrollment emails can be configured into one System.\n\n\nThis feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location. \n\n\nDetailed information on steps to configure this can be found on the Knowledge Base \nHERE\n. \n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\nHere you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an Admin or Manager attempt to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.\n\n\nThe Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.\n\n\nTypically you will want to customize this per client/System and include an email or support number to contact.\n\n\nLightPad Settings\n\n\nThe LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)\n\n\n\n\nEnable LightPad Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn off or on the LightPad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad From Address\n\n\nThis field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LightPad Support Yes/No\n\n\nThis feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support Title\n\n\nThis is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Button Name\n \n\n\nThis is the name of the button users click to send a message to support. Example: Click Here for Help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Image\n \n\n\nEnter the path to the Image. This image appears next to the support verbiage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Recipient\n \n\n\nEnter the Username of the person who will receive these messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Verbiage\n \n\n\nEnter the Support Verbiage. This text appears on the main LightPad form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Instructions\n \n\n\nEnter the Extended Instructions. This text appears on the page where the user sends the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery Options\n\n\nThese settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System. \n\n\nOnce these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendgrid Subuser\n\n\nThis feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function. \n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where, in theory, a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for.

            "text": "System Information  This section controls general system information.  Note: We use the term \"Legacy\" for more than a few of these settings. Legacy means the toggle or setting only exists because OLD Systems may use the toggle, and that newer methods have been invented to update the toggle or setting. Anything marked Legacy will direct you where to go to update the setting in question.    System Name  This is where we set the name of the System - you should never edit this (Accounting only)    Exit URL  This is the URL to take the user to once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to the client's login page.     System Active Yes/No  This toggle will activate/deactivate the system.    System Status  Choose from: In Factory, Live, Preso (Presentation), or Internal    System Description  This area is to briefly describe the System.     Content Containers   Here we can assign a system to a Content Container. This is how we keep the content isolated so that it is not possible (without severe human error) for content to cross over into unintended systems. It is possible for multiple systems to pull all from the same Container - but it is not possible for one system to pull from multiple Containers.   Use Content Container Yes / No  If this system is not yet attached to a container, you will be given the option to create one for it. If this system is already attached to a container, you will be given the option to manage that container.    Auto Populate Content Roles Yes / No  -  Default: No  It is possible to auto-populate content roles based on access levels. For example, if you want to ensure that when a \"Manager\" access level is assigned, you can auto-populate the desired Management Content Roles. This makes it easier to ensure each user is receiving the proper content when being created - either by a human or through the API.    Content Role and Access Level Instructions  Here you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:  Content Roles:  Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.  Access Levels:  Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time.        System Settings  Below are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.   Allow SU B Extended Privileges  -  Default: No  This allows the SUPER USER B access level to be enabled to grant different system admin privileges. If this is YES, then each desired \"Super User B\" needs specifically to be touched to be set - it is not a \"carte blanche\" setting for SUBs at this system.    Search Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the search feature.    Favorites Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the Favorites feature.    Ratings Enabled  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the Ratings feature.    Show Chapter Extras (TC Tubes)  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the \"tubes\" that appear below chapter titles in the training center.    File Vault Active / Friendly Name (Legacy)  -  Default: Yes  This will turn on/off the File Vault. You can also rename the File Vault here for Legacy systems. Any newer system using Themer 2.0 will need to be renamed in there.    Show Teams  -  Default: Yes  When teams are ON, each location has their own ability to create their own teams. The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.  Use Teams Plus  - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found  HERE .    Show Job Positions  -  Default: No  This will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position. A Super User B with the \"Manage Systems\" privilege can manage the Job Positions. This setting is \"System Wide\" (not able to be different per location)    Show User Interests (Legacy)   Default: No  This is a feature that was partially built and not ready for use.    Show Lock Username/Password   Default: No  This is a feature that is useful when there is another system integrated into LSVT, where the other system is controlling/creating usernames and passwords - such as NCM, and you want to have a Toggle on the user's profile where they cannot update/change the username or password. This is so it does not get out of sync with the integration.    Use HTML Main Menu (Legacy)   Default: Yes  This is a toggle to switch between the main menu using Flash code or HTML code. This needs to be YES for all new clients.    Use Blue Steel (HTML Training Center) (Legacy)   Default: Yes  Similar to the toggle above, this is a toggle to switch between using Flash or HTML. This needs to be YES for all new clients.    Use Boilerplate   Default: Yes  The Boilerplate is the most basic component of the LSVT platform and represents the global UI of the system. It may help to think of it as the \"Page Template\" of the system. This toggle is controlled by the System Design team when they create the initial theme and will be set to YES for all new clients.    Use Main Menu 5000   Default: Yes  This toggle goes hand-in-hand with the Boilerplate and Themer 2 - the System Design team will toggle this when they create the initial theme and it will be set to YES for all new clients.    Use Themer 2   Default: Yes  This will enable the System to use the new Themer. As above, the System Design team will toggle this when they create the initial theme and it will be set to YES for all new clients.    Enable Notes (HTML Training Center / Report in Search)   Default: Yes  This toggle will control the \"My Notes\" tab that shows up on the left side of the video player in the Training Center. There is also an over ride at the COURSE and CHAPTER level, in case a client has something like a \"Final Compliance Course\" where they do not want NOTES on that particular course or chapter available.    Mobile Skip Video Disable   Default: No  Mobile devices by default can fast forward through content. Enabling this toggle will check the length of the chapter, say 5 minutes, and if the user completes the chapter before that 5 minute runtime, it will prevent them from moving forward to the test or next chapter, and they'll be forced to watch the chapter again.    VMS Enabled (Legacy)   Default: No  This feature is in progress and not ready for LIVE yet.    Calendar Enabled   Default: Yes  On legacy systems, this turns on automatically in the System Modules on the Main Menu. On newer systems, the System Design team must manually add the button to the Theme. This is a System wide setting.    Google Analytics Account ID  This is an account number specifically for this client. It allows the client to utilize Google Analytics to track usage around their system. This is typically added by the System Design team.    TC Home Icon URL (Legacy)  Use this to override the HOME icon URL in the Training Center. Example: /tc/#/trainingcenter/topics/acme_main - this is a Legacy setting. On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.    TC Use New Category Layout   Default: No  Changing this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.    TC Layout Column Count    If the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.    Boilerplate Theme URL  This URL is added by the System Design team, it tells the System which CSS file to use for the Theme.     Language Settings   Enable Google Translation   Default: Yes  Google Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of our System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.    Enable Smartling Translation   Default: No  If utilizing Smartling, then turn off \"Google Translation.\" Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few words to \"translate\" per System, depending on what buttons they may have renamed.     More information on Language and System Localization can be found  HERE .  Enrollment  As a default, this is a System setting, however it can also be configured per Theme - so it is possible that many multiple Enrollment emails can be configured into one System.  This feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location.   Detailed information on steps to configure this can be found on the Knowledge Base  HERE .   Location Settings  Here you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an Admin or Manager attempt to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.  The Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.  Typically you will want to customize this per client/System and include an email or support number to contact.  LightPad Settings  The LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)   Enable LightPad Yes/No   Default: Yes  This will turn off or on the LightPad    LightPad From Address  This field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.    Custom LightPad Support Yes/No  This feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.    LightPad Support Title  This is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!    Support Button Name    This is the name of the button users click to send a message to support. Example: Click Here for Help.    Support Image    Enter the path to the Image. This image appears next to the support verbiage.    Support Recipient    Enter the Username of the person who will receive these messages.    Support Verbiage    Enter the Support Verbiage. This text appears on the main LightPad form.    Extended Instructions    Enter the Extended Instructions. This text appears on the page where the user sends the message.      Message Delivery Options  These settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System.   Once these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.  Once toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.  Adding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.  Once the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.   Message Delivery - LightPad   Default: Yes  This will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad.     Message Delivery - SMS   Default: No  This will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.)     Message Delivery - Email   Default: No  This will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.    Sendgrid Subuser  This feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.     Note: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function.   Watchdogs  The Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where, in theory, a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be activated under System Settings, and configured per location as desired.   Watchdog Enabled Yes/No   Default: Yes     Training Expectations Friendly Name       Progress Report Friendly Name     User Tracker Friendly Name      Search Settings  This is an open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword. We can also add a drop-down contextual menu to force desired search words/phrases.   Use Search Terms Yes/No   Default: No     Search Terms        Certification Settings (Legacy)  **Note to Brian: double check on where these are set... in System or Themer? Both?
