More advanced Configuration steps are covered in the \nContent Administrator\n section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nEven though in the LightSpeed heirarchy the Topics menu comes first, it is an optional componant, so we're going to start with Categories. This is explained in more detail in the Topics section.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n1. Categories Overview\n\n\nA category is made up of courses, a description (in text), an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image tile.\n\n\nTo get started, navigate to Manage Content under the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then \n402 - Content Management.\n You will see a screen that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Category\n\n\nFrom this screen you can either \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n. For this lesson, click on \nCreate a new category.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Category\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your category by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied From\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be populated automatically if you created this category using the \"Copy\" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEnter the description of the category. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a category belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumb Nail Image Path\n\n\nEnter the image path to the category image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on our cloud server. Because we did not build the image yet, put in a generic path as a placeholder: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/client_name/tiles/category_name.jpg\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that in the \nContent Containers / Activation\n section.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollover Image URL\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nEnter the path to the category rollover image - this is similar to the Thumb Nail Image Path above, where you can enter a generic path for now.\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-composed Yes/No\n\n\nThe default setting here is usually \"No\". The \"No\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"Yes\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (css, flash, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-composed = No\n\n\nPre-composed = Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nYou may ignore the \"VT2GO\" section here for now, we'll cover that in a later topic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Courses Overview\n\n\nA Course is made up of a series of Chapters, a description (in text), an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and a Course Preview Trailer (video).\n\n\nCreate new Course\n\n\nNow that your category is created, you can click on the \n\"Courses\"\n tab at the top of your screen, and then click on \n\"Create New Course\"\n.\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Course\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your course by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the course here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied From\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be populated automatically if you created this course using the \"Copy\" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEnter the description of the course. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a course belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this course should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select \"Yes\" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that in the \nContent Containers / Activation\n section.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Course - Reports\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will show/hide the course in reporting sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Course - Search\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will toggle the course from being searchable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for the entire course. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Chapter level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this course will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the course will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first course. Rank 999 = the very last course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is for the duration, in minutes, of the course. (This feature is currently not in use.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Chapters in Order\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this toggle to \"Yes\" will force the user to complete the chapters in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumb Nail Image Path\n\n\nEnter the path to the course image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on our cloud server. Because we did not build the image yet, put in a generic path as a placeholder: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/client_name/tiles/course_name.jpg\n\n\nNote: We will cover the image creation and uploading/pathing it to the server later in the \nArtwork Design\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview Path\n\n\nEnter the path to the course video preview (If this is your initial build, you likely do not have this video yet, so you can leave this path blank for the Content Admin to populate.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nEnter the name of the author of this material (Usually the client's name - but if it's a collaboration, enter the name of the System, ex. Patricia Fripp as an individual, or NCM OnDemand as a collaboration, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\nAdd any keywords associated with this course. These should be separated by a pipe \"|\" - ex. Sales|Selling|Closing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Assignment\n\n\nSelect which category this course should go in. For this exercise you will choose the category you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivileges\n\n\nYou can leave these access level privileges blank. These are for legacy clients that are not yet on Content Containers. However, if a group is NOT on content containers, then these access levels would be used (but this is rare - all new groups should be on content containers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. You can leave this empty for now - this is covered more in the Content Administrator section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout Fields\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. You can leave this empty for now - this is covered more in the Content Administrator section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nYou may ignore the \"VT2GO\" section here for now, we'll cover that in a later topic.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Chapter Overview\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from an existing \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top.\n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 1\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\nCreate your chapter by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nYou must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\nNote: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nFor a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4\n - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. \nLeave Blank for now.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank. \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRehash/Recap - Video Path\n\n\nA recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a \nrecap\n before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Question\n - \nBe sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.\n\n\nThis is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.\n\n\n4. Test Questions (Quick) Overview\n\n\nThere are 4 main testing mechanisms, we'll only cover #1 in this section. More on test questions can be found in the \nContent Administrator\n section:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Choice\n\n\nDrag and Drop / Order\n\n\nMatching (Match a Term to a Definition)\n\n\nFill in the Blank\n\n\n\n\nCreate new Test Question\n\n\n\n\nAfter your chapter has been saved, click on \n\"Add Question\"\n and follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the question text. For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: \nDid you understand everything in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF File Path (Not Required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is named for some legacy test question content, and it is used presently for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWF Data (not required)\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field is similar to the one above - it is used for some legacy content and it is also used for new content - but for this exercise you can leave it blank for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A) \n B)\n\n\nThis field is for the first possible test question answer. For this exercise enter this as the answer: \nYes\n\n\nIn the \nAnswer B)\n field, enter: \nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Correct / Inc.\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n dialogue pop-ups will not be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the \nResponse Info\n field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Info\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer\n\n\nHere you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold \nCtrl/Command\n you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the fields are complete, hit \n\"Save\"\n and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nAnd that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.\n\n\nNow, if your initial build calls for it, let's quickly cover the Topics menu. Topics are different from the rest because (as of 6/16/2015) there hasn't been an Admin menu created for it.\n\n\nSo let's dive right in...\n\n\n5. Topics\n\n\nThe topics menu in LightSpeed VT is a simple way to group categories together and display them in a condensed format. Remember - the reason we do this step last is because now you can add your list of Categories to your topic menu. Also please note that this step may be completely optional to your build - depending on the outline.\n\n\nFirst, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.\n\n\nAdd the Topic to the Database\n\n\nTo get started let's add the topic to the database. We do this from the Super User Dashboard, \n400 - Application Administration\n, and then click on \n408 - Use Topics\n\n\n\n\nOn this screen there are only 2 fields to worry about:\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nEnter the name of your topic - it needs to be lower case, and with no special characters or spaces. Example: \nABC Motors\n you might call it: \nabc_motors\n - and please note that this should match the topic XML File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML File\n\n\nThis name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word \n\"topics_\"\n and \n\".xml\"\n to the filename. For example, \nabc_motors\n will now be: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is now complete.\n\n\nCreate the Topic XML\n\n\nNow you're ready to create a topic XML. \nDownload a Sample \nHere\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate an existing topic XML\n\n\nDownload an existing topic XML to your desktop and rename it to the same filename you just entered in the previous step. Ours will be named: \ntopics_abc_motors.xml\n - Or download the sample XML file above and edit that one.\n\n\nTopics are stored in this folder on the lsvt-cloudfront server: lsvt-cloud-front/topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration via XML\n\n\n\n\nThe topics menu uses XML configuration files to specify settings. The following values are supported:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n - HTML formatted text that will be displayed over the topic icons.

Active  You must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.    Rank  The Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the  higher  the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.    Number of Test Questions  -  Default: 1  Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that  \"pool\"  of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.  Note: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.    Test Pass Percentage  -  Default: 100  Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.    Test Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)  Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test.

Test Type  -  Default: Standard  Your options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found  here .    Pull Questions in Order By Rank  -  Default: No  This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.    Fail Test on Incorrect  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.    Answer Notifications  -  Default: No  Setting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address  per answer  which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.    Show Test Stats  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.    Show Test Summary Nav Buttons  -  Default: Yes  This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.    Enable Notes  -  Default: Yes  This will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should  always  be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.    Social  -  Leave blank for now.  You can enter in social information  per chapter .    Chapter Part Info  -  Default: 1  You must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.     Once you have filled out each field, hit  Save .

Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path  Video Path : This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)  For a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use:  http://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4  - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.    Mobile Path : This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.  Leave Blank for now.  Asset Path : This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself. Most of the time this can remain blank.  Leave blank for now.    Rehash/Recap - Video Path  A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a  recap  before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.    Add Question  -  Be sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.  This is where you can add test questions to this chapter. We'll cover that in the next section.

First, we want to add the topic information to the database, and then we'll create an XML file that will list all of the topics and categories. We'll then upload that XML to the cloud server and finally update the theme to access the topics menu.  Add the Topic to the Database  To get started let's add the topic to the database.

XML File  This name should be the same as topic name you entered above, except we add the word  \"topics_\"  and  \".xml\"  to the filename.

For the legacy themer, navigate to the Super User Dashboard,  400 - Application Administration , and then click on  403 - Manage Legacy Themes   Select Your Theme  Select the theme you are modifying from the drop-down menu. We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar.    Update the Main Menu Coursel  Select the Main Menu tab at the top  Hover over the \"Select\" link to identify which carousel panel is currently linking to the Training Center, and click on the pencil/edit icon. The link will be something like: /v4/training_center.cfm, or /tc/  Once that menu appears, update the Link Url - you will want it to say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Save.    Update the Top Nav bar  Click on the Top Nav tab at the top of the screen and then click on the Pencil/Edit icon next to the \"Training Center\" menu link.  Modify that link the same way you did for the main menu, adding \" ?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the url so it reads: \"/v4/training_center.cfm?type=abc_motors\" and then hit save.     \n     \n        Important Note\n     \n     \nWhen you are done managing a theme, be sure to return to the  \"Select Group\"  tab and select LightSpeed VT - Mission Control. This will place you back at your home location group so you cannot accidentally overwrite any settings.",

Navigate to the Super User Dashboard,  400 - Application Administration , and then click on  403 - Manage Themes   Select Your Theme  Select the group are modifying from the drop-down menu  (1) , and then click on  \"Edit Theme\"  next to the group  (2)  (see screenshot below). We'll be modifying two menus - the main menu carousel, and the top navigation bar. Both of these can be found under the  \"Components\"  menu in the top nav area.     Update the Main Menu Carousel  Select the Main Menu Carousel from the Components tab at the top  Click on  \"Edit\"  next to the  \"Training Center\"  Carousel   Now update the Link Url - you will need to add  \"?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update.     Update the Top Nav bar  Select  \"Menus\"  from the Components tab at the top.  Find the  \"Top Nav Menu\"  From the list of menus (usually it is the first one)  Click on  \"Edit\"  next to the  \"Training Center\"  line   Now update the Link Url - similar to what you just did on the Carousel - you will need to add  \"?type=abc_motors\"  to the end of the URL, so it should say: /v4/training_center.cfm?type= abc_motors  (where abc_motors is the name of the TOPIC you entered way up at the beginning of this lesson) and then click Update.  Note:  This is a good example, where this link is currently pointing to  /tc/  - so you'll want to replace that link completely with the information above.
