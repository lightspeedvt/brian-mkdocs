Until they are granted access to additional Locations; all of the tools or reports they utilize will simply just show data from their own Location - nothing more.\n\n\nThere are really two main \u201cUser Cases\u201d for needing to add more abilities to these Super Users, and they are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranting a \u201cMulti-Location Overseer\u201d the ability to administer more than their own Location. This is for your clients that may own more than one Location, and need to administrate its users and run reports. -OR-\nPerhaps you have a large sales team, and you want to give certain sales reps oversight over only \ntheir\n customer Locations - this is handy for that reason too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating another \u201cTop Level\u201d admin other than yourself that has the ability to administer certain settings over the entire \u201cSystem.\u201d This may be to manage content or other \u201cTop Admin\u201d tasks that more users at your company may be doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-Location Overseer\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first \u201cUser Case\u201d mentioned above. This is when you have a \u201cMulti-Location Overseer\" that you want to grant them the ability to administer more than one Location. This means that when they go to the Super User Dashboard, any of the tools or reports that they go to use, will have these additional Locations included in them. \n\n\nAnytime they see a Location name that is clickable, they can click that Location name and go administer that specific Location. We call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d to that Location.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User at Access Level \u201c3\u201d (Super User C), just like you would create any user (or change their Access Level if they already exist). Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - User Management / Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a line of info text near the top that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThis will tell how you how many Locations this user has Super User access to, it also has:\nA clickable link that says \u201cView Super User Access\u201d and if clicked, a modal window will appear with a list of Locations that this Super User has Access to.\nAnother clickable link that says \u201cEdit Super User Access\" and if clicked, will take you to the Admin area where you now designate additional Locations that this user can have access to.\n\n\nYou can select which \u201cSystem\u201d you want to get a list of Location for (if there is more than one), and also specify a Location Name (or part of one) and indicate if you want results of both Active \n Inactive Location, or just one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get the results from that search, you will see a list of Locations, and a \u201ccheck box\u201d to the left of each one. By checking (or unchecking) these boxes, you can determine which Locations this Super User has access to.\n\n\nAt the bottom, you can select what \u201cupdate type\u201d you want to do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Selected - this will leave whatever settings are in place, and merely \u201cAdd Selected\u201d Locations that you \u201cchecked\u201d above to it. It is harmless if you add a Location twice - don\u2019t worry about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete All Existing and Add Selected - this is handy if there are 100\u2019s of Locations listed and you want to ensure you only give this person distinct access to whatever you just \u201cchecked\u201d so this will remove any settings that were there prior, and ONLY add the new ones you \u201cchecked.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Selected - this is where you want to remove certain ones only. This will take into account what is currently \u201cchecked\u201d for this user, and then delete the ones you have selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \u201cSave Super User Access Changes\u201d once you are done making changes.\n\n\n\n\nSuper User-ing to Locations\n\n\nWhen you want to bounce around to other Locations and look in on users, run reports, etc. - we call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d around. So, then you are in the Super User Dashboard, anytime you see a Location name that is linked, you can click on the Location Name, and you will be \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to that Location, and dropped at the \u201cMain Menu.\u201d \n\n\nNow, don\u2019t get confused as it may look a lot like every time you sign in as yourself, BUT... it\u2019s not. You are seeing the view as THAT LOCATION you \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to - and you will see the Location name on the top right - check it out in the screenshot below. I have left my primary Location, and I \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to a different Location called \u201cACME Blue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf there is other branding items that are different than your primary Location then you will see a lot of the branded artwork and such for that Location you Super User\u2019d to - that\u2019s normal. You can now click in to the top nav menu and access the Quick Links, and they will all be relative to that Location you are now Super User\u2019d to. Examples are:\n\n\nManage Users\n - you will now be administrating users at THAT Location only.\n\n\nReport Cards\n - you will now be viewing Report Cards on users at THAT Location only.\n\n\nLocation Settings\n - you will now be changing \u201cLocation Settings\u201d at THAT Location only.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nOne important thing to know is - if you click on the TRAINING CENTER while you are Super User-ing around, you will still always see YOUR \u201cTraining Center\u201d - NOT the Location you have Super User\u2019d to. \u2026 and the reason is\u2026 YOUR username likely has very different Content Roles than the Users at the Location you are Super User\u2019d to. Or at the very least, what user Content Roles are you expecting to be represented to see here? It is impossible to know. If you want to see what that specific TRAINING CENTER looks like, you will need to \u201cimpersonate\u201d a user and then look (learn about the impersonation feature \nHERE.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Creating another \u201cTop Level\u201d Admin (Super User B)\n\n\nYou will likely have the need to create other top level \u201cSuper Users\u201d at your company, and you will want to grant them appropriate privileges to administer a lot the settings in the VT System. This section will briefly explain how you can create and administrate Super User B\u2019s for your organization, as you can grant them as many or as few privileges as you wish.\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User B, just like you would create any user - likely at your \u201cAdmin Location.\u201d Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a new \u201ctab\u201d on the top called \u201cSuper User B Privilege\u201d and if you click on that tab, will then see all of the privileges listed out, and a \u201cYES/NO\u201d toggle for each.

Your organization is a \u201cSystem\u201d within the VT Platform, and in a prior Help Doc, we looked at the \u201cLSVT Hierarchy\u201d and saw how the Systems, Themes, and Locations all work together - as they are all under the umbrella of a \u201cSystem.\u201d\n\n\nIn this section, we will walk through the System settings so you understand what they are and how they work so that you can edit and administrate them as you need. \n\n\nNote\n: Changing System Settings can affect all of your Themes, Locations and Users, so if you have questions - \u201cCall Before You Dig.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTo get to the System Settings, first go to the Super User Dashboard, then open up the subsection labeled \u201c400 - Application Administration\u201d and you will see the tool called \u201c401 - System Management\u201d as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you select, this, you will be able to select which \u201cSystem\u201d to edit (or if you only have one, it will default to that one).\n\n\nThis next screen is a large one, and has lots of sections within it that expand and collapse to make them easier to get in and edit one area at a time. This Help Doc will walk you through and explain each section. Once you modify any settings in any of these sections, you will need to click the \u201cSAVE\u201d button at the bottom for them to be updated and saved.\n\n\n System Information\n\n\n\n\nExit URL\n\n\nThis is the URL where a user will go once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to your front door sign in page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Content Containers\n\n\n\n\nContent Role and Access Level Instructions\n\n\nHere you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:\n\n\nContent Roles:\n Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.\n\n\nAccess Levels:\n Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n System Feature Toggles\n\n\nBelow are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.\n\n\n\n\nSearch Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the search feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorites Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Favorites feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Ratings feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Chapter Extras (TC Tubes)\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the \"tubes\" that appear below chapter titles in the training center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Vault Active / Friendly Name\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the File Vault.

The Grace Period allows you to give the Location a grace period to renew by. If you choose to Auto Expire a Location, it will expire on the Grace Period Date. Alternatively, if no Grace Period Date is entered, the Location will expire on the Contract End Date.   \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \nIf you intend for this Location to just renew in a \u2018month to month\u2019 format after the Contract End date, then simply do not check the \u201cAuto Expire\u201d check box, and it will not get automatically deactivated on that date and it will roll over to a \u2018month to month\u2019 status.\n        Billing Notes - this is an open text field for you to note anything you would like the LSVT Accounting Dept. to know. These notes are only seen by you and the LSVT Accounting Dept.- they are not seen on the front end by your customers.  Contract - this is where you will upload the contract for this New Location to be stored.\n(end bullet list)   Step 4.  - Location Notes - this is a simple optional open field that you can utilize to indicate any helpful \u2018notes\u2019  about this Location that you and your customers can see on the front end to better describe what the Location is being used for.

Content Roles are the actual \u201cRoles\u201d that are assigned to users on the front end. A User can be assigned as many Content Roles as needed.\n\n\nHere is a corny yesteryear analogy in hopes to help understand how Categories and Content Roles are used to control how users see Courses. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1995 and you are going into a video rental store. All of the DVD movies (and maybe even some VHS tapes back in 1995) are \u201cCourses\u201d and each section of the store is a \u201cCategory.\u201d There are sections like; Comedy, Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance, etc. So the entire store is like a  Content Container, and each of the sections that you can browse in the store are your \u201cCategories.\u201d But now you also have the ability to have these \u201cContent Roles\u201d which can limit, or determine what movies you see in each section. Let\u2019s say you are a Kevin Bacon fan and thus you are a member of a Content Role called \u201dSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\u201d And now, if you are part of that Content Role, you would only see movies with Kevin Bacon in them (or someone that is six degrees of Kevin Bacon), as you browse through each section of your store.\n\n\n\n\nOkay back to the technical stuff. You can create as many Content Roles in your Content Container as you want to, and put as many Courses in each one as you want to also. You can put the same Course in multiple Content Roles if needed too. You can also add a description for each Content Role, so that when you are seeing them on the front end, you can see these descriptions to better describe what type of Courses are in these Content Roles. There is also the ability to \u2018rank\u2019 the Content Roles too. This is important, as this is the sort order that these Content Roles appear on the front end of the System, when you are assigning them to users.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201cContent Roles\u201d tab in the Content Container. Here is a walk through of the screenshot below, and some information on each item that you can edit.\n\n\n\n\n1...  This is where you create new Content Roles. You can specify here if you want to create it as \u2018Standard\u2019 or Premium.\u2019 If you know it is intended to be a Premium Content Role, this saves you some time here, as it will automatically mark it as \u201cPremium\u201d on ALL Locations right now (and save you the step to do that later\u2026 but you can always change your mind and do it later too).\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nNext to each Content Role name, you will see it\u2019s ID# in a bracket, such as [2563] in this example. Everything in the LSVT System has a unique ID# - be it a System, a Theme, a Location, a Course, a Content Role, etc. - and they are always indicated in a \u201cbracket\u201d like that. This helps you identify them with a unique ID# as well as these ID#\u2019s are used in some of the more advanced config areas of the System as you learn more about them.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n2... Here is a list of all of your Content Roles. You can see the name and the description you gave them. This name and description is also seen by users on the front end, so name and describe them carefully. They aren\u2019t marked \u2018Standard\u2019 or \u2018Premium\u2019 here, because one Content Role may be \u2018Standard\u2019 at one Location, but \u2018Premium\u2019 at another, and we\u2019ll get in to that shortly.\n\n\n3... Here is where it shows the \u2018Rank\u2019 which determines the sort order that they appear on the front end. You can also see the total number of Courses within a each Content Role (click that number and a pop-up dialog will appear showing you the list of Courses by name) and also a link to \u201cmanage\u201d\u2019 the Courses within that Content Role, which is where you can add and subtract Courses within that Content Role as needed.\nIf you click the \u2018name\u2019 of the Content Role, you can administrate some further details about it - let\u2019s take a look at that next.\n\n\n\n\n4... In the top area you can see the number of Courses assigned to this Content Role and the number of users that are also assigned to it. Each of those numbers can be clicked to view the list of each.\n\n\n5... In this area you can edit the name of your Content Role, update the Description of it, make it Inactive if you are wanting to turn it off, and also change the Rank easily too.\n\n\n Standard vs. Premium Content Roles\n\n\nA Premium Role is a Content Role that is not visible to be added/selected in the User's profile by standard overseers or managers, but can be added/selected by a Top Admin. This may be useful where there is \"Premium Content\" that can be purchased by individual users at a location, and by it being a Premium Content Role, a Manager at that location cannot assign this Premium content to a user without oversight by a Top Admin, or a paid transaction. By a paid transaction, I mean that if there is content that can be purchased via an ecommerce transaction, it may be contained in a Premium Content Role, so that standard users and managers cannot add it on their own, without making the purchase or transaction.\n\n\nThe Premium Content Roles will also allow for you to hide desired Content Roles at desired Locations, as it is a \"Per Location\" Setting. What this means is that if you have some Content Roles that are only applicable for a certain number of Locations and not all Locations, this gives you the ability to \"hide\" these sensitive Content Roles as needed from certain Locations.\n\n\nIf you have access to Premium Content, you can view and modify this content in two areas:\nThe first area is in the tab in the Content Container area called \u201c\u2018Premium\u2019 Content, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the first two columns list your Location ID#\u2019s and Names, then each Content Role is listed with a \u2018check box\u2019 to allow you to indicate any desired Content Role to be \u2018Premium\u2019 at that specific Location. In my example above, the \u2018Gold Package\u2019 is a Content Role that I have marked as \u2018Premium\u2019 at all of my Locations.\n\n\nThe second area that Premium Content Roles are visible is when you are using the \"Manage Users\" tool at a Location, or in the Super USer Dashboard. When you select a user to edit their profile, you will see a section below the \"Standard Content\" section where you can add or remove \"Premium\" content.\nIn the screenshot below, you can see the entire Content Role area that you would see on each user\u2019s profile, and which ones from our examples above are Standard vs. Premium. I am seeing the Premium Content Roles because \n\n\nI am viewing it as a Top Admin with that privilege. A regular Overseer (or Manager) at this Location would only see the Standard Content Roles.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see in the example screenshot above, that this user is set to two of the Content Roles, so that when they go to the Training Center, they will see the Courses that are inside those two Content Roles, in whatever Categories that those Courses are in.\n\n\nContent Roles will be a big part of the conversation about Administering your System in a lot of areas, and we will go into more detail in each area where they have different settings that apply to different things, so we\u2019ll be talking about them in many places throughout these Help Docs.\n\n\n Role and Access Mapping\n\n\nThis is the other tab that is available within the Content Container feature. This is a very powerful tool to map Content Roles to users post launch. As you add new Content Roles, you will likely need to map them to existing users, or even change how some existing Content Roles are assigned, and this is a very flexible tool that gives you several options to do this.\n\n\nThere are three mapping tools for you to use:\n\n\n1... \nMap an Access Level to another Access Level\n\n\nThis will Re-Assign all users at the selected System assigned to one Access Level to a different/new Access Level. You can also specify which specific Locations, or ALL Locations. This would remove Access Level \"X\" from all users and make them the new Access Level \"Y.\"\n\n\nThis is helpful if you decide to change your Access Levels post launch, and you have a bunch of users already in use. You can use this tool to migrate them to a different Access Level if needed.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n2... \nMap One or More Content Roles to an Access Level\n\n\nThis is helpful if you have a new Content Role, and know exactly what type of user will need it, based on their current Access Level. Or, do the inverse, and remove a Content Role.\nFirst, specify which specific Locations, or ALL Locations.\n\n\nThen select whether you want to \u201cAdd\u201d - \u201cRemove\u201d or \u201cAdd and Replace\u201d a list of Content Roles, based on a user's Access Level.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nThis tool is handy if you want to completely remove an existing Content Role from everything. You can remove it from each Access Level, one at a time, and unassign it from basically \u201call\u201d users, as a Content Role won't let you make it Inactive if it has ANY users still assigned to it.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n3... \nMap One or More Content Roles to an existing Content Role\n\n\nThis is similar to the one we just talked about, but this one is helpful if you have a new Content Role, and know exactly what type of user will need it, based on one of their current Content Roles (vs. Access Level). Or, do the inverse and remove a Content Role.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.",

Content Roles are the actual \u201cRoles\u201d that are assigned to users on the front end. A User can be assigned as many Content Roles as needed.  Here is a corny yesteryear analogy in hopes to help understand how Categories and Content Roles are used to control how users see Courses. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1995 and you are going into a video rental store. All of the DVD movies (and maybe even some VHS tapes back in 1995) are \u201cCourses\u201d and each section of the store is a \u201cCategory.\u201d There are sections like; Comedy, Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance, etc. So the entire store is like a  Content Container, and each of the sections that you can browse in the store are your \u201cCategories.\u201d But now you also have the ability to have these \u201cContent Roles\u201d which can limit, or determine what movies you see in each section. Let\u2019s say you are a Kevin Bacon fan and thus you are a member of a Content Role called \u201dSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\u201d And now, if you are part of that Content Role, you would only see movies with Kevin Bacon in them (or someone that is six degrees of Kevin Bacon), as you browse through each section of your store.   Okay back to the technical stuff. You can create as many Content Roles in your Content Container as you want to, and put as many Courses in each one as you want to also. You can put the same Course in multiple Content Roles if needed too. You can also add a description for each Content Role, so that when you are seeing them on the front end, you can see these descriptions to better describe what type of Courses are in these Content Roles. There is also the ability to \u2018rank\u2019 the Content Roles too. This is important, as this is the sort order that these Content Roles appear on the front end of the System, when you are assigning them to users.  Let\u2019s start with the \u201cContent Roles\u201d tab in the Content Container. Here is a walk through of the screenshot below, and some information on each item that you can edit.   1...  This is where you create new Content Roles. You can specify here if you want to create it as \u2018Standard\u2019 or Premium.\u2019 If you know it is intended to be a Premium Content Role, this saves you some time here, as it will automatically mark it as \u201cPremium\u201d on ALL Locations right now (and save you the step to do that later\u2026 but you can always change your mind and do it later too).  \n     \n        Tip\n     \n     \nNext to each Content Role name, you will see it\u2019s ID# in a bracket, such as [2563] in this example. Everything in the LSVT System has a unique ID# - be it a System, a Theme, a Location, a Course, a Content Role, etc. - and they are always indicated in a \u201cbracket\u201d like that. This helps you identify them with a unique ID# as well as these ID#\u2019s are used in some of the more advanced config areas of the System as you learn more about them.\n       2... Here is a list of all of your Content Roles. You can see the name and the description you gave them. This name and description is also seen by users on the front end, so name and describe them carefully. They aren\u2019t marked \u2018Standard\u2019 or \u2018Premium\u2019 here, because one Content Role may be \u2018Standard\u2019 at one Location, but \u2018Premium\u2019 at another, and we\u2019ll get in to that shortly.  3... Here is where it shows the \u2018Rank\u2019 which determines the sort order that they appear on the front end. You can also see the total number of Courses within a each Content Role (click that number and a pop-up dialog will appear showing you the list of Courses by name) and also a link to \u201cmanage\u201d\u2019 the Courses within that Content Role, which is where you can add and subtract Courses within that Content Role as needed.\nIf you click the \u2018name\u2019 of the Content Role, you can administrate some further details about it - let\u2019s take a look at that next.   4... In the top area you can see the number of Courses assigned to this Content Role and the number of users that are also assigned to it.

Once you put a video in your Media Library, you can use, and reuse it as many times as you like.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nThe video you upload is commonly referred to as your \u201csource\u201d video.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you add a new video to the Media Library, you can do this by going right to your Media Library in the Super User Dashboard, or you can also do it right inline, while you are adding or editing a Course.\n\n\nEach video you add will need a \u201cVideo Name\u201d and a \u201cVideo Description.\u201d These are for your internal reference only and are not displayed to your user on the front end. This is simply to make it easy for you to find and use these videos at a future time. We will put a \u201cLast Modified\u201d stamp on each video in your Media Library as well to assist you for future reference.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nOnce you have added video to your Media Library, you can swap out the actual video at a future time, however, this in itself will not add/replace this new video to any Chapters or areas that have used the prior video. You will still need to navigate to that desired chapter and update it to use the newer video from this Media Library entry. This is a fail-safe to ensure you don\u2019t add/update anything unintentionally.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Encoding Settings\n\n\nWhen encoding videos, you will want to have as high quality video as you can to start with - the ole\u2019 Garbage In = Garbage Out analogy. Below are some answers to commonly asked questions about this process to best assist you in making your video look the best it can.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat video format should my source video be?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nPretty much anything that is \u201creally\u201d a video. \nCLICK HERE\n to jump down this page and take a detailed look at acceptable video formats.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat resolution or size should my video be?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nWe playback videos at a 16:9 ratio, ideally 1280 (width) by 720 (height). However any size of 16:9 will scale in fine. If your video is not a 16:9 ratio, we will help you and add a \u201cpad\u201d around it to fill up the space to that ratio. We don\u2019t goof up your video by stretching it to an odd size that looks bad.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nHow long will it take to encode my video?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nThat depends how fast your Internet upload speed is to upload it, and then also how long (in duration) your video is to encode it.\n\n\nThe basic process is:\n\n\n\n\nWe will upload your video, and you will see a progress bar on this process. A five minute video typically takes less than 30 seconds to upload.\n\n\nWe will encode your video to all of the different target formats to be compatible across desktop and mobile formats. A five minute video typically takes about three minutes to encode.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Do not close the pop up window until the file has completed uploading and processing.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat type of video player do we use?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nIt isn't any \"type\" of video player - it is our \"Custom VT Player\" which uses some industry standard elements, then a lot of customizations we have done that our specific to our System. \n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nWhen you are adding video to the Media Library, a small window will pop open to indicate the process of that one video uploading and encoding. You can navigate your main window back to the Media Library and upload a second (or more) videos in additional pop up windows. When they are done uploading and encoding they will save back to the Media Library on their own for convenience.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Encoding Output Specifics\n\n\nOnce you upload your source video, we will encode it to these different formats for adaptive streaming, and we will \u201cAuto\u201d select the right one for the user, based on your available bandwidth and/or device, dynamically during playback.

            "text": "When encoding videos, you will want to have as high quality video as you can to start with - the ole\u2019 Garbage In = Garbage Out analogy. Below are some answers to commonly asked questions about this process to best assist you in making your video look the best it can.  QUESTION: \nWhat video format should my source video be?  ANSWER: \nPretty much anything that is \u201creally\u201d a video.  CLICK HERE  to jump down this page and take a detailed look at acceptable video formats.  QUESTION: \nWhat resolution or size should my video be?  ANSWER: \nWe playback videos at a 16:9 ratio, ideally 1280 (width) by 720 (height). However any size of 16:9 will scale in fine. If your video is not a 16:9 ratio, we will help you and add a \u201cpad\u201d around it to fill up the space to that ratio. We don\u2019t goof up your video by stretching it to an odd size that looks bad.  QUESTION: \nHow long will it take to encode my video?  ANSWER: \nThat depends how fast your Internet upload speed is to upload it, and then also how long (in duration) your video is to encode it.  The basic process is:   We will upload your video, and you will see a progress bar on this process. A five minute video typically takes less than 30 seconds to upload.  We will encode your video to all of the different target formats to be compatible across desktop and mobile formats. A five minute video typically takes about three minutes to encode.   Note:  Do not close the pop up window until the file has completed uploading and processing.  QUESTION: \nWhat type of video player do we use?  ANSWER: \nIt isn't any \"type\" of video player - it is our \"Custom VT Player\" which uses some industry standard elements, then a lot of customizations we have done that our specific to our System.   \n     \n        Tip\n     \n     \nWhen you are adding video to the Media Library, a small window will pop open to indicate the process of that one video uploading and encoding. You can navigate your main window back to the Media Library and upload a second (or more) videos in additional pop up windows. When they are done uploading and encoding they will save back to the Media Library on their own for convenience.",

            "text": "Courseware Management - Overview\n\n\nThis article is an overview on how the \u201cCourseware Management\u201d area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.\n\n\nWhen your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users within it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\n\u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Upload your videos into the Media Library\n\nThe Media Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Media Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.\n\n\nStep 2: Assemble your videos into Courses\n\nOnce you have one or more videos in the Media Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Media Library first). These videos will also be added to the Media Library for you automatically.\n\n\nStep 3: Add your courses to Content Roles\n\nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d ... all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.\n\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you set up your content like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role\n\n\nContent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Strategies\n\n\nThis has courses on Sales training AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nThis has courses on mandatory Compliance training AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront Desk Training\n\n\nThis has courses on How To Run the Front Desk AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from this example that all 3 roles have their own unique content, as well as sharing the \"New Hire Orientation\" content. \n\n\nStep 4: Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location\n\nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.\n\n\nStep 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired\n\nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are Active at their Location.\n\n\nIn the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being inactive and they are grayed out.\n\n\nYou will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. \n\n\n\n\nHere is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d\n\n\nYou can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.\n\n\nHere is a visual representation of that example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role Name\n\n\nCourses in this Role\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nCompliance, New Hire Orientation, AND California ONLY Compliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Location Course Settings\n\n\nCourse Active?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance - California Only\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Location Course Settings\n\n\nCourse Active?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance - California Only\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, a user could have the Compiance content role, and still only see the content that they are assigned, because the course is not active at their location.\n\n\nThis flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.\n\n\n\n\n Categories\n\n\nThis section will help you create a new Category. A category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Training Center before you hover over a category tile with your cursor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a cursor rolling over the center Category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, there are two images for the center Category. One thumbnail, and one rollover thumbnail.\n\n\nOkay let's dive into Courseware Management - After you have selected your content container, you can either select \nCategory List\n, where you can \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n.\n\n\nWhen you click on the \nCategory List\n option, if you have any existing categories they will be displayed like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatID\n\n\nRank\n\n\nCategory Name\n\n\nInternal Desc.\n\n\nCourses Assigned To\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a unique identifyer for this Category.\n\n\nThis is order in which this category will display in the Training Center.

(Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not display for anyone until you complete the very last step of the activation process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: Auto Ranks\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Type\n - \nStandard or List of Links\n\n\nA category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\". A \"List of Links\" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. You may use the \"List of Links\" Category Type to add additional organization layers to your Training Center. \"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category. Please \nCLICK HERE\n to see more information about your Training Center Hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Name\n - \nRequired Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nHere you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device. After you have selected an image from your local device, and hit 'save', the thumbnail will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail Roll Over (Optional)\n - \nThis can be left blank\n\n\nHere you can enter the path to the category rollover image, OR choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen to Thumbnail\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThe \"Yes\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"No\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen = Yes\n\n\nAdd Sheen = No\n\n\nCharlie Sheen = Winning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Warning - File Size Best Practices\n    \n\n    \n\nLSVT does not compress or resize your images. Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep the file size low, and use the correct dimensions, when uploading these thumbnails. For example, if you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Category - Additional Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the description of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the internal description.

To add more Content Roles now, click on \"Content Containers\" in the top navigation bar now. We cover Content Containers and Roles in the \nContent Containers\n section of these Help Docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n Chapters\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part consists of either an .m3u8 Playlist (for Adaptive Streaming) or an .mp4 file (for Progressive).\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nOnly a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA chapter with a test can be followed by a \"Recap\". A \"Recap\" can be text or video, that will play if the user fails to pass the test. This is optional, however it is recommended you include this for each chapter. (In some scenarios, if you have a 10 minute chapter, and the user fails the test, it is a better user experience to have the user review a brief recap, 1-2 minutes, rather than go through the entire 10 minute video again)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n while editing an existing \ncourse\n. The \"Chapters\" section will become active after you have saved and created your course.\n\n\n\n\n Create or Edit a Chapter - Basic Info\n\n\nFirst decide which type of chapter this is. There are 4 basic types:\n\n\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss each in detail below.\n\n\nBegin by filling The Rank, Chapter Name and Chapter Type. Pay special attention to the warning messages here, they're very important to be able to navigate further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter. The system will populate a default rank 1 higher than the previous chapter automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Name\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Type:\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \"default\" test summary Navigation buttons\n\n\nIn chapter type 1, 2 and 4, you have the option to show or hide the automatic navigation buttons. If set to yes, navigation buttons will appear on the test summary screen directing the user to either move on to the next course, or visit the course menu to select new content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This friendly warning you may have seen already, but it's there to remind you to save your work!\n\n\n This friendly note is letting you know that you must SAVE the chapter before adding any test questions. (You can't add test questions to something that doesn't exist! By saving the chapter, you are \"creating\" it in our database, and therefore we have something to attach the test questions to.)\n\n\n You can see here the \"Test Settings\" section is grayed out. As soon as you hit Save it will be accessible!\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at the different chapter types.\n\n\n Chapter - Standard (Video and Test)\n\n\nIn a Standard chapter type, the chapter must have at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nIf you've already uploaded and encoded your video file, you can add that now by clicking on \n\"+ Add Chapter Part\"\n and selecting the file path from your Media Library.\n\n\nIf you're still waiting for your files to upload and encode, you can come back to this section at any time and add your chapter part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Add Chapter Part\n\n\nClick on the \"Select From Library\" button and select a video to add to this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You'll notice now that we saved, the \"Test Settings\" link is no longer grayed out.\n\n\n We still cannot active this chapter until we add at least 1 test question!\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nWe will be continuing with this section as if you already have a video ready to add to this Chapter. If you still need to upload and encode your video file(s), please check out our section on the \nMedia Library\n for tips and best practices.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Summary Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (This screen is displayed before the user starts the test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (This is seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. This could be the default message, or if it's the last chapter of a course you could direct the user to the next training content, or even add supplemental information such as a PDF download or link to a 3rd party site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (This is seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. This could be the default message, or words of encouragement, or hints as to how to pass the test, or anything really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also make available \"Default Text\" options in case you are unsure what to put here.\n\n\n Chapter - Social Settings\n\n\nPlease visit \nTHIS\n Knowledge Base article for more information on the Social Settings feature.\n\n\n Chapter - VT2GO Settings\n\n\nVT2GO settings are covered \nHERE\n.\n\n\n Chapter - Test Settings\n\n\nIn order to access the additional test settings we must enter our first test question. Currently the only available test type is \"Standard\" which is Multiple Choice. More test types are coming soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Add Question\n\n\nAdd a question, let's get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes. If you need to later turn this Question off you can do so here, or on the previous screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n. Otherwise it will still randomize all of your test questions even if a rank is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the test question text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in seconds, how long the question timer should be. We default the timer to 60 seconds. You may go as high as 999 seconds (which is about 16-17 minutes). If you enter \"0\" in the field, it will remove the timer altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Options (Select which answer is correct by checking the box)\n\n\nAnswer A is for the first possible test question answer. Answer B is the second option, and down the line to F. There can be 6 possible answers, but you are only required to use a minimum of 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Correct or Incorrect Answer Graphic\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n graphic pop-ups will not be active. Note: These must be checked in order for the text or video answer response action to appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected, then you can select that video from your library. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Text\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Settings\n\n\nAfter you have created your first question, navigate back to the \"Test Settings\" tab and you can now view and modify the additional settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then the system will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Sort Order\n - \nDefault: Random\n\n\nRandomize the questions: This will pull all of the test questions randomly.\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank: This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap\n\n\nIf you add a recap, and the user fails the test, then the user will be prompted to take the \nrecap\n before taking the test again. If they then fail the test a second time, they will have to take the training from the beginning of the chapter again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have added as many test questions as you need, remember now to activate your chapter and move on to the final activation steps!\n\n\n Chapter - Test Only\n\n\nIn a Test Only chapter type, the chapter will have no video parts, and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nYou will see that once you change the Chapter Type, the screen changes slightly. You no longer have the option to add a video to this chapter - as it is a test only.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Video only (With Auto Advance)\n\n\nIn a Video Only chapter type, the chapter will only have a video part, and no Summary or Test Question options.\n\n\nA chapter set to Auto Advance will automatically begin playing the next chapter once it is done. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Warning\n    \n\n    \n\nYour final chapter of your course CAN NOT be set to this chapter type, or it will cause an error. The system will have nothing to auto advance to once the course is completed!\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Video only (With Summary)\n\n\nThis is similar to the option above, however in this case you can add a Summary to give the user additional information, direct them to another area of the system, or to simply say congratulations before they move on to the next chapter.",

            "text": "This article is an overview on how the \u201cCourseware Management\u201d area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.  When your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users within it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.  \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \n\u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d\n        Step 1: Upload your videos into the Media Library \nThe Media Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Media Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.  Step 2: Assemble your videos into Courses \nOnce you have one or more videos in the Media Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Media Library first). These videos will also be added to the Media Library for you automatically.  Step 3: Add your courses to Content Roles \nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d ... all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.  For example, let\u2019s say you set up your content like this:     Content Role  Content      Sales Strategies  This has courses on Sales training AND New Hire Orientation    Compliance  This has courses on mandatory Compliance training AND New Hire Orientation    Front Desk Training  This has courses on How To Run the Front Desk AND New Hire Orientation     You can see from this example that all 3 roles have their own unique content, as well as sharing the \"New Hire Orientation\" content.   Step 4: Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location \nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.  Step 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired \nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are Active at their Location.  In the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being inactive and they are grayed out.  You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role.    Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:  Let\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d  You can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.  Here is a visual representation of that example:     Content Role Name  Courses in this Role      Compliance  Compliance, New Hire Orientation, AND California ONLY Compliance        Regular Location Course Settings  Course Active?      Compliance  Yes    Compliance - California Only  No        California Location Course Settings  Course Active?      Compliance  No    Compliance - California Only  Yes     In this example, a user could have the Compiance content role, and still only see the content that they are assigned, because the course is not active at their location.  This flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.  \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n       So, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.",

Once downloaded and launched, users will sign in with their Web App login credentials. In other words, only ACTIVE (subscribed via the Web App) usernames will be able to successfully sign in from the Mobile App and utilize its unique features. The mobile app has been built to accommodate users with multiple profiles (and user names) at once, just as you might access two Twitter accounts from the same device - you would simply select which profile you want to utilize when launched. \n\n\nContent - There will be different/alternate content available for the Mobile App vs. the Web App, with the understanding that: \u201cJust because it is available on the Web App, doesn't mean it will automatically be available on the Mobile App.\u201d Primarily, this is because not every piece of content is Mobile App-friendly.

And a Course will need to be in a Content Role before it can really be released out to the world in any way. So, this section is going to assume you already have your Courses created, and have put them into Content Roles, and now you want to make them available at Locations - and thus for Users. If you're still unclear how to get this far - Check out the \n\"Courseware Management\"\n section and then come back here.\n\n\nOkay, you will first want to Super User to the Location where you want to Active/Deactivate the Course(s) - the most common way is go to the Super User Dashboard, and use the \u201c102 - Location Management\u201d Tool - and search for the Location you want, and click on it so that you are Super User\u2019d to it. You\u2019ll double check you are in the correct Location by seeing the Location name on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nThen go to the \u201cLocation Settings\u201d - this button is located in the Quick Links menu that is tucked in to the top of every screen.

The LSVT API acts as a liaison to the VT Application. You are able to hit these \u201cmethods\u201d (represented in the dotted lines) and perform the noted tasks, such as; Create Users, Update Users, Create Locations, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Webservices\n\n\nLightSpeed VT has its own internal \u201cmiddleware\u201d component, which we call our \u201cLSVT Webservices Control Panel\u201d and this has some built in integration points, that use the LSVT API, and some other internal and external tools. Currently, the LSVT Client Care Team will configure anything in the Webservices Control Panel for you, but we are rapidly preparing these tools to be client facing as well.\n\n\nBelow are some of the \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d tools that the Webservices Control Panel can configure.\n\n\n\n\n Chargify\n\n\nLightSpeed VT is already integrated with Chargify\u2019s API\u2019s making it a \u201cready to go\u201d solution for recurring billing for your customers. LSVT can help get you set up on our \u201cumbrella\u201d account so that it makes the setup process even quicker.\n\n\nYou will be provided a credential to sign in to your Chargify account and \u201cmanage\u201d your products and customers subscriptions.\n\n\nThe LSVT Client Care team will do the needed configuration to get your Chargify account talking to your VT System so that when a user makes a purchase, the appropriate privileges and account information is all set up.\n\n\nEach \u201cproduct family\u201d in Chargify will have a \u201cCheckout Page\u201d that is built in the Webservices admin area.

It is basically a way for users to \u201cRegister\u201d and get an account. Each Registration Form is configured to create a user at a certain Location, with predefined Access Levels and Content Roles.\n\n\nPromo Codes\n\nThe Reg Form can also utilize \u2018Promo Codes\u201d where a cod is required in order to Register - we can generate codes for you. Codes can be unique and only able to be used once, or we can create you codes that can have a certain amount of uses, or infinite.\n\n\n Email Notifications\n\n\nThe Webservices Control Panel can configure email notifications to go to users based on the following events:\n\n\n\n\nCourse Completion - when a user completes a course, the email gets triggered to go out in real time.\n\n\nChapter Completion when a user completes a chapter, the email gets triggered to go out in real time.\n\n\nNumber of days with no sign in\n\n\nNumber of days after \u201cSign Up\u201d (Start date)\n\n\nNumber of days prior to account expiration\n\n\n\n\nTo set these up, the information we will need from you is:\n\n\n\n\nThe IDs of the Courses/Chapters desired, or the \u201cnumber\u201d of days (whichever is applicable)\n\n\nEmail from \u201cName\u201d and \u201cEmail Address\u201d\n\n\nEmail subject line\n\n\nEmail body text\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is the dynamic data that is available to use in the body text:\n\n%%courseid%%\n\n%%coursename%%\n\n%%datetimecompleted%%\n\n%%email%%\n\n%%firstname%%\n\n%%lastname%%\n\n%%locationid%%\n\n%%locationname%%\n\n%%phone1%%\n\n%%phone2%%\n\n%%userid%%\n\n%%username%%\n\n\n Unlock Content - Event Trigger\n\n\nThe Webservices Control Panel can be configured to change a user's Content Role(s) based on Course or Chapter completions.

This is an example of a File Vault with NO content in it.\n\n\n\n\nNew Folder Creation\n\n\nAs a Location Manager or User with privileges to add files to the File Vault, they will do so in the File Vault itself:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a System Admin, to create files and folders you would access the File Vault Admin area under the Super User Dashboard, 412 - File Vault Management:\n\n\n\n\nSystem Admin Screen\n\n\nIn the Admin area, you will first select a System in which you want to manage the file vault files.\n\n\nSecond, if you wish to search for a specific Folder or File, you can do so here. If you want to see all available Folders and Files for the system, leave these fields blank.\n\n\nAfter searching, results can be filtered further by location. By selecting a location, only folders active at that location will show.\n\n\nStep 1: Select your System and search criteria:\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Review your results or filter by location:\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new folder click on \"New Folder\" icon at the top right.\n\n\nEnter your information for the folder and then whether or not you would like ALL newly created locations in your system to have access to this folder (It will be checked by default, or set to Yes)\n\n\nNext, specify which locations can access the new folder (In our example there is only 1 location available, so only 1 is on the list). \n\n\nTo the right of the location access, the System Admin can also grant authorization for a location manager to deactivate this folder (or as we'll see later, file.)\n\n\nSuccess!

            "text": "Here are some basic volcabulary terms to familiarize yourself with:\n\n\nSystem\n\nThis is the fully functional \u201cSystem\u201d that is the granddaddy object that holds all of your Private Labeled Themes, and Locations and users as well as the key to your destiny. A \u201cSystem\u201d is what we configure A to Z for a client of LightSpeed VT.\n\n\nPrivate Labeled Theme\n\nWhen a client of ours takes on a large customer that wants their system \u201cPrivate Labeled,\u201d this is how we will accommodate that. It has a series of branding abilities and settings that give you the flexibility to \u201cPrivate Label\u201d your System. (Note - every System has art least one \u201cTheme\u201d which is your default theme).\n\n\nLocation\n\nThis is the organizational \u201cunit\u201d that holds end users.\n\n\nContent Container\n\nThis is where all of the Courseware Content is held. All of your Courses are here, and these can be used, and re-used across the entire System; which means, in any/all Private Label Themes and Locations.\n\n\nVideo Library\n\nThis is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to upload and encode videos content that will be used in the Courseware Management toolset.\n\n\nCourseware Management\n\nThis is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to Add/Edit courseware.\n\n\nContent Role\n\nThis is how you organize your Courses to be privileged to Users. A Content Role is simply made up of a list of Courses, and when a user is set to a Content Role, they may be able to have access to the Courses within it (assumingly said Courses are \u201cActive\u2019 at their Location).\n\n\nPremium Content Role\n\nThis is simply a Content Role that is set to \u201cPremium\u201d and thus only available to specified \u201cSuper Users\u201d or \u201cTop Admins.\u201d These are used for content that is reserved for premium needs and may be a premium purchase, therefore you do not want Location Managers turning this on for users on their own (as they need to purchase it). These \u201cPremium Content Roles\u201d can be set per-Location for further flexibility.\n\n\nSuper User Dashboard\n\nThis feature allows access to all of the multi-location administration and reporting tools.\n\n\nMain Menu\n\nThis is the first screen users are presented with upon successful sign in. This is springboard or \u201cMain Menu\u201d that has access to all of the features and areas of the System that users need, via the Carousel Panels, the System Modules and the Quicklinks, to name a few.\n\n\nMain Menu Message (Video)\n\nThis Main Menu Message is automatically displayed within the Main Menu upon an end-user\u2019s first sign-in experience. This is typically used to introduce them to the VT System experience. Additionally, new Main Menu Messages can be inserted here for future communication needs, in which all users will see upon next signin. All users can replay the current Main Menu Message at any time.\n\n\nMain Menu Carousel Panels \n Carousel Panel Previews\n\nThese are the primary navigation panels, providing access and explanation to function that all users regularly use. On each carousel panel, there is an option for an approximate 30-second message that all users can click on and see. Use our default host or insert your own talent/host via custom videos.\n\n\nMain Menu Bulletin Board\n\nCustomizable text heading and greeting appearing at the top of the Main menu interface (administrable by location via location administrator \n Super Users).\n\n\nLeft and Right Side Banner Graphics\n\nDisplays custom, location-specific artwork and messages on the Main Menu.\n\n\nMy LightPad\n\nUser-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nSearch\n\nAn open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword. We can also add a drop-down contextual menu to force desired search words/phrases. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nEnd User Click Agreement\n\nLightSpeed VT offers the ability for you to have your end users go through a \u201cClick Agreement\u201d process upon first signin. The Click Agreement is a \u201cLocation\u201d specific setting and is presented to the user upon first sign in and they must click \u201cI AGREE\u201d before it will allow them to proceed. This is a text-based agreement and needs to be provided to LSVT to be implemented at the desired locations (or all locations).\n\n\nAPB \u2013 All Points Bulletin\n\nA \u201csplash screen\u201d that users see to put some communication or messaging on. This can be; video based, image and/or text based. This prompt can be inserted either as soon as a user signs in, or as soon as they click \u201cTraining Center.\u201d This is an optional screen and can be designated per location. There is also a toggle to indicate whether users can \u201cclick to now show this message again.\u201d This feature is commonly used to announce actionable messages, as you can link to any other feature or screen to do a desired activity.\n\n\nMy Report Card\n\nA multi-level report for each user to see their own progress within the training content available to them. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score.\n\n\nMy Usage Report\n\nThis is a usage report that provides a visual dashboard of activity, or lack thereof. It includes sign in activity and content usage and can be filtered in many ways, including by date range. (NOTE: The name of this report may be changed as desired.)\n\n\nMy Profile\n\nA screen where each user can edit their own profile (access to this can be toggled off per user as desired.)\n\n\nMy Favorites\n\nQuick access to a list of training Chapters that each user may have indicated as their favorites. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration. \u201cFavorites \n Ratings\u201d are tied together as one feature.)\n\n\nFile Vault\n\nA repository to place downloadable resources for each location. Location administrators and managers also have access to add resources to this File Vault for their location as desired. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nMy Certifications\n\nThis is where users can see any \u201cCertification\u201d that are available to them. There may be more than one certification available to them at a time. A Certification can be assigned to an Access Level, and is made up of a set of courses. Once all of the courses are complete within a Certification, a printable certificate with the private label logo and colors is available for the user. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nMy Billing Profile\n\nIf the Chargify subscription shopping cart is tied to a location, this is the button a user will click to alter their billing details, such as; update credit card information, upgrade/downgrade subscription, and cancel subscription. (NOTE: They \u201cMy Billing Profile\u201d feature is disabled in the System configuration if Chargify is not utilized.)\n\n\nCalendar\n\nThis is a \u201cTo-Do\u201d Calendar for end users to use. This first version of the Calendar is location centric, and unique per user. This means that the assignments and the viewing of the Calendar is at the \u201cLocation\u201d level, not the Super User, or Multi-Location level in this version. Events can be added/updated a few different ways. Users can create events for anything they would like, such as: appointments, reminders, training task, etc. Admins/Managers can assign events to one or more users and can view calendars of Users to see if the events have been completed.\n\n\nMy Notes\n\nNotes are enabled on each chapter in the Training Center, which adds a \u201cMy Notes\u201d tab on every video. This allows the users to click this tab, and it will expand a little note pad where they can take notes on each chapter as they follow along with the video. These notes can be reviewed at anytime by clicking \u201cMy Notes\u201d from the System Modules on the Main Menu and all of the chapters that notes were taken on, will output here. These notes can be searched, printed and exported to a PDF as desired.\n\n\nAdmin Quick Links Menu\n\nThis menu is visible only to Location Managers, Administrators and Super Users (it is hidden to standard users) and contains all of the buttons to access the features and reports that are needed to oversee and administrate the System.\n\n\nReport Cards\n\nA multi-level report for managers to select desired users and view their progress within the training content available to each user at that location. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score. Results can all be exports to serve additional needs.\n\n\nUsage Report\n\nThis report is for managers to select desired users and a date range and view their history of usage including sign ins, content usage and pass/fail attempts. This is plotted against a date range with graphs to provide a visual of their activity or lack thereof. This report is a multi-level report allowing the manager/admin to click on the data and get a drilled down view of what makes up each of the summary numbers.\n\n\nContent Report\n\nThis is a multi-level report allowing a manager/admin to select a date range, and then any desired Category, Course and Chapters and view total usage on each piece of content, and also drill down to see the \u201cattempted/pass/fail\u201d data on each, and additionally click each of those numbers to reveal what users and dates comprise those summaries.\n\n\nManage Users\n\nThis allows for the administration of all of the users at this location. It provides menus to create/edit users, as well as search for users based on some different filters and sorting criteria, as well as export these search results for additional needs.\n\n\nAuto Email Upon User Creation\n\nThis feature can email a notification to the user, that their username has been created. This is handy so that as Admins/Managers create users, those users are automatically notified that their account has been created.\n\n\nEnrollment\n\nThis allows Admins/Managers (who have the privilege to \u201cCreate Users\u201d) to easily enroll users at their location. This feature allows the Admin/Manager to define what type of user they want to enroll, then there are two options on how to notify users: 1) the Admin/Manager can enter or upload a list of email addresses and the System will notify these users via email to complete their enrollment, or 2) the System will generate a unique URL/link that can be used in other ways, such as: email campaigns, printed on collateral, etc.\n\n\nLocation Settings\n\nAdministration menu for location information. Settings include: Address Information, the Main Menu Bulletin Board, and Location Graphic Tiles/Side Banner.\n\n\nWatch Dogs\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where, in theory, a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be configured per location as desired.\n\n\nAccess Levels\n\nThis is what defines a user\u2019s privileges, or \u201caccess/no access\u201d to administrative features. Example: Manager vs. Standard User (this is a distinct set of levels that are defined later in this document).\n\n\nContent Roles\n\nThis designation defines what content is available to each user. A user can be a member of multiple \u201cContent Roles\u201d allowing for infinite flexibility for designating content to users.\n\n\nTeam\n\nThis allows for the administration of teams at each location. A team can be set up to organize users for reporting reasons. Once a team is created, it will appear on the user\u2019s profile and each user can be assigned to a team. On the reports, there is then a filter for viewing by teams. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nCategories\n\nCourses are organized into Categories in the Training Center Menu. Categories are controlled from the top level of the application and may be toggled on per location. If a Category is toggled off for a specific location, none of the users will be able to see any of the Courses that are inside that Category. Once a user clicks on a Category, a list of Courses is presented.\n\n\nCourses\n\nA Course is made up of a series of Chapters, a Course description (in text), a Course thumbnail (picture or image representing the Course) and a Course Preview Trailer (video). You can decide if a user can take the Chapters in any order they choose, or if they are required to take them in order.\n\n\nCourse Preview Trailer\n\nA short video (approximately 30 seconds) that gives the user a brief explanation of what the course will cover.\n\n\nChapter\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter (Chapter module) of their choice (if they are not required to take the Chapters in order). When all Chapters in a Course are complete, the Course is then marked complete. A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter module may consist of up to multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of one of the following media types: video, Flash SWF, or PDF document. A Chapter may consist of training parts and a Chapter test; training parts and no test; or no training parts and only a test. A test may be followed by an optional \u201cRecap\u201d Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test.\n\n\nPlayback Privileges\n\nFast-forward and the \u201cskip\u201d button are only available to top level location managers, administrators and Super Users by default. There is optional configuration to make additional access levels have these privileges.\n\n\nCaptions\n\nClosed Captions can be added to each Chapter, allowing users to toggle Captions on and off for their desired language. (NOTE: Content needs to be transcribed with time code and then also translated into a desired language.)\n\n\nFavorites and Ratings\n\nThe ability for a user to mark this Chapter as a Favorite, and also rate it on a scale of 1 to 5. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nSocialize\n\nThis feature provides the ability for your users to post to social networks, specifically Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin, after they complete interactive training Chapters.",
