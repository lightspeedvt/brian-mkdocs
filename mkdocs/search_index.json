Until they are granted access to additional Locations; all of the tools or reports they utilize will simply just show data from their own Location - nothing more.\n\n\nThere are really two main \u201cUser Cases\u201d for needing to add more abilities to these Super Users, and they are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranting a \u201cMulti-Location Overseer\u201d the ability to administer more than their own Location. This is for your clients that may own more than one Location, and need to administrate its users and run reports. -OR-\nPerhaps you have a large sales team, and you want to give certain sales reps oversight over only \ntheir\n customer Locations - this is handy for that reason too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating another \u201cTop Level\u201d admin other than yourself that has the ability to administer certain settings over the entire \u201cSystem.\u201d This may be to manage content or other \u201cTop Admin\u201d tasks that more users at your company may be doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-Location Overseer\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first \u201cUser Case\u201d mentioned above. This is when you have a \u201cMulti-Location Overseer\" that you want to grant them the ability to administer more than one Location. This means that when they go to the Super User Dashboard, any of the tools or reports that they go to use, will have these additional Locations included in them. \n\n\nAnytime they see a Location name that is clickable, they can click that Location name and go administer that specific Location. We call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d to that Location.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User at Access Level \u201c3\u201d (Super User C), just like you would create any user (or change their Access Level if they already exist). Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - User Management / Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a line of info text near the top that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThis will tell how you how many Locations this user has Super User access to, it also has:\nA clickable link that says \u201cView Super User Access\u201d and if clicked, a modal window will appear with a list of Locations that this Super User has Access to.\nAnother clickable link that says \u201cEdit Super User Access\" and if clicked, will take you to the Admin area where you now designate additional Locations that this user can have access to.\n\n\nYou can select which \u201cSystem\u201d you want to get a list of Locations for (if there is more than one), and also specify a Location Name (or part of one) and indicate if you want results of both Active \n Inactive Locations, or just one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get the results from that search, you will see a list of Locations, and a \u201ccheck box\u201d to the left of each one. By checking (or unchecking) these boxes, you can determine which Locations this Super User has access to.\n\n\nAt the bottom, you can select what \u201cupdate type\u201d you want to do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Selected - this will leave whatever settings are in place, and merely \u201cAdd Selected\u201d Locations that you \u201cchecked\u201d above to it. It is harmless if you add a Location twice - don\u2019t worry about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete All Existing and Add Selected - this is handy if there are 100\u2019s of Locations listed and you want to ensure you only give this person distinct access to whatever you just \u201cchecked\u201d so this will remove any settings that were there prior, and ONLY add the new ones you \u201cchecked.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Selected - this is where you want to remove certain ones only. This will take into account what is currently \u201cchecked\u201d for this user, and then delete the ones you have selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \u201cSave Super User Access Changes\u201d once you are done making changes.\n\n\n\n\nSuper User-ing to Locations\n\n\nWhen you want to bounce around to other Locations and look in on users, run reports, etc. - we call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d around. So, then you are in the Super User Dashboard, anytime you see a Location name that is linked, you can click on the Location Name, and you will be \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to that Location, and dropped at the \u201cMain Menu.\u201d \n\n\nNow, don\u2019t get confused as it may look a lot like every time you sign in as yourself, BUT... it\u2019s not. You are seeing the view as THAT LOCATION you \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to - and you will see the Location name on the top right - check it out in the screenshot below. I have left my primary Location, and I \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to a different Location called \u201cACME Blue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf there is other branding items that are different than your primary Location then you will see a lot of the branded artwork and such for that Location you Super User\u2019d to - that\u2019s normal. You can now click in to the top nav menu and access the Quick Links, and they will all be relative to that Location you are now Super User\u2019d to. Examples are:\n\n\nManage Users\n - you will now be administrating users at THAT Location only.\n\n\nReport Cards\n - you will now be viewing Report Cards on users at THAT Location only.\n\n\nLocation Settings\n - you will now be changing \u201cLocation Settings\u201d at THAT Location only.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nOne important thing to know is - if you click on the TRAINING CENTER while you are Super User-ing around, you will still always see YOUR \u201cTraining Center\u201d - NOT the Location you have Super User\u2019d to. \u2026 and the reason is\u2026 YOUR username likely has very different Content Roles than the Users at the Location you are Super User\u2019d to. Or at the very least, what user Content Roles are you expecting to be represented to see here? It is impossible to know. If you want to see what that specific TRAINING CENTER looks like, you will need to \u201cimpersonate\u201d a user and then look (learn about the impersonation feature \nHERE.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Creating another \u201cTop Level\u201d Admin (Super User B)\n\n\nYou will likely have the need to create other top level \u201cSuper Users\u201d at your company, and you will want to grant them appropriate privileges to administer a lot of the settings in the VT System. This section will briefly explain how you can create and administrate Super User B\u2019s for your organization, as you can grant them as many or as few privileges as you wish.\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User B, just like you would create any user - likely at your \u201cAdmin Location.\u201d Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a new \u201ctab\u201d on the top called \u201cSuper User B Privilege\u201d and if you click on that tab, will then see all of the privileges listed out, and a \u201cYES/NO\u201d toggle for each.

It is basically the Parent of the bunch. This tells us if your username is located within a system residing in this account, you will have access to this sign in page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Template Theme\n\n\nWith this option, you can choose to change the theme of the \"Retrieve Password\" email. If you have Multiple Systems with Multiple themes and sign in pages, this maybe be useful for you. Otherwise it will usually just be one default theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nThis is the name that will appear on the Title of the site (in the browser) and also in the admin area so you can easily identify it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Terms of Service\n\n\nThis is optional if you'd like us to turn on a generic terms of service link. (Typically the user has already agreed to the terms of service before they arrive at this point, so we included the option to hide it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Privacy Policy\n\n\nThis is similar to #5, it is an optional toggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Social Media Sign In Integrations\n\n\nIf you would like your users to be able to use Google, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn credentials to sign in to LightSpeed, you should enable this option. As long as the email address on their social account matches the one entered in LightSpeed, they will be able to login with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nThis is just an easy toggle to turn the page on or off\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nThis will allow you to see who created the site and who was the last to update it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Here is a graphic that will help show which settings control which areas of your sign in page. Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\n Content\n\n\nThe Content section covers the images and custom text you can modify on your sign in page. Below are some detailed descriptions as well as some screenshots similar to above showing what section affects which area of the sign in page.\n\n\nHeader\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\n\n\nTypically this will be the same logo we use when building your System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront Door Link\n\n\nThis allows users to click on your logo to visit your main website - this URL can be anything you wish. Typically this is the main marketing site for your System, or where users came from after they click \"Sign In.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nChoose a background image, typically we will match this image to the one we use inside of your System - but you can change this to anything you like if you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Link\n\n\nIf you have a direct link to a \"Join\" or \"Sign Up\" page for your system, you can enter that here. This is here in case a user navigates to this Sign In page before they have an account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Link Target\n\n\nIf you want to open the above link in a new window, or use the same window (we usually suggest a new window).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Link Name\n\n\nThe default Join Link name is \"Join Now\" - If you enter anything into this field then you override that if you want to customize it. (eg. \"Join Right Now!\", \"Get Started!\", \"Sign Up Here!\", etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\nSign in Text\n\n\nThis text appears above the sign in area, you can customize it to how you see fit, a good default for this is something like, \"Please enter your username and password below to sign in.\" If you leave it blank, a default sentence will be used like the one in our example screenshot: Sign in with your Acme Black Account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\nThe Help section can be found by clicking on the \"Need Help?\" link on the main sign in page. The only two required fields here are the Message and the Email fields - if the rest are left blank they simply will not appear.\n\n\n\n\nSupport Message\n\n\nYou can use this section to enter important information about your support hours or .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Page\n\n\nHere you can enter a link to your support site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nEnter your Support email address here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone\n\n\nEnter your Support phone number here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Styles\n\n\nMain\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader Background Color\n\n\nThis color is set using an RGBA value. You can use the color picker to choose it, or you can enter the value manually. The 4th number in the list controls whether or not the background section is transparent or visible. (1 for visible, 0 for transparent). Setting this to 0 will cause the bar to disappear and the rest of the background image will be viewable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm Color\n\n\nThis is the main color of the form itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Color\n\n\nThis is the main color for the text found on the main section of the page - everywhere you see neon green (in our example) is where this is controlled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Color\n\n\nAnywhere there is an HTML or navigation link on the page, it is controlled by this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Color\n\n\nThe Error Color (not shown in the screenshot) will change the color of the Username and Password fields if the user enters incorrect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Color\n\n\nThis controls the color of the Secure Server link and LightSpeed VT Logo - you can adjust this as necessary to contrast and stand out from your background image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm Fields\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Color\n\n\nThis will set the background color of the Username and Password fields - the color only appears when the user clicks on it to activate the field and enter their information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Color\n\n\nIf the user is entering correct information, the text will stay this color - as well as the underline you see below it in the screenshot. If there is an error, the text will change color to the setting below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Text Color\n\n\nIf the user tries to submit invalid information, the sign in page will report an error. When the user returns to the field that has an error, the text color will change and use this setting (it is portrayed as YELLOW text in the screenshot below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Color\n\n\nThis will set the background color of the highlight that appears when you hover over the Sign In and other buttons on the page. This also controls the outline color of the Social Share buttons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Color\n\n\nThis is the color that the text will CHANGE to once you hover over. So here in our example our text color is BLACK so it shows up in contrast to the green background color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Metadata\n\n\nWe added a Metadata section so you could input your own keywords and description if desired for better SEO.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\nEnter any amount of keywords for your site here, separated by a comma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nEnter a standard definition for your site, typically this is what will be displayed by a search engine if it's found through that medium. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Retrieve Password Settings\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email\n\n\nThis will be what the end user sees as who the email is from. Typically you will want to use a REAL email address, rather than something that does not exist, as email spam filters tend to block those out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Subject\n\n\nEnter what the email subject will be - something like, \"The information you have requested\" or \"Your Forgot Password Information\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Top Copy\n\n\nYou can enter anything here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Bottom Copy\n\n\nYou can enter anything here, typically some sort of signature or link back to your website or support site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NEW - Google Analytics\n\n\nYou can now enter your Google Analytics ID or Tag Manager ID to begin using Google Analytics tracking.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics ID\n\n\nGoogle Tag Manager ID",

Your organization is a \u201cSystem\u201d within the VT Platform, and in a prior Help Doc, we looked at the \u201cLSVT Hierarchy\u201d and saw how the Systems, Themes, and Locations all work together - as they are all under the umbrella of a \u201cSystem.\u201d\n\n\nIn this section, we will walk through the System settings so you understand what they are and how they work so that you can edit and administrate them as you need. \n\n\nNote\n: Changing System Settings can affect all of your Themes, Locations and Users, so if you have questions - \u201cCall Before You Dig.\u201d - 1-800-HEY-LSVT (1-800-439-5788)\n\n\nTo get to the System Settings, first go to the Super User Dashboard, then open up the subsection labeled \u201c400 - Application Administration\u201d and you will see the tool called \u201c401 - System Management\u201d as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you select, this, you will be able to select which \u201cSystem\u201d to edit (or if you only have one, it will default to that one).\n\n\nThis next screen is a large one, and has lots of sections within it that expand and collapse to make them easier to get in and edit one area at a time. This Help Doc will walk you through and explain each section. Once you modify any settings in any of these sections, you will need to click the \u201cSAVE\u201d button at the bottom for them to be updated and saved.\n\n\n System Information\n\n\n\n\nExit URL\n\n\nThis is the URL where a user will go once they sign out. Clicking the Sign Out button will first end the user's session with LightSpeed and then take them to the URL. Typically this is set to your front door sign in page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Content Containers\n\n\n\n\nContent Role and Access Level Instructions\n\n\nHere you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:\n\n\nAccess Levels:\n Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time.\n\n\nContent Roles:\n Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n System Feature Toggles\n\n\nBelow are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.\n\n\n\n\nSearch Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the search feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorites Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Favorites feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings Enabled\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the Ratings feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Chapter Extras (TC Tubes)\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the \"tubes\" that appear below chapter titles in the training center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Vault Active / Friendly Name\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on/off the File Vault.

Any newer system using Themer 2.0 will need to be renamed there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Teams\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nWhen teams are ON, each \nlocation\n has their own ability to create their own teams. The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes (HTML Training Center / Report in Search)\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will control the \"My Notes\" tab that shows up on the left side of the video player in the Training Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalendar Enabled\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will turn the Calendar off and on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics Account ID\n\n\nThis is an account number specifically for you.

Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Social Media Bar\n\n\nThis will enable/disable sharable social media links that will appear on the left side of the screen (on all screens) - Here you can also limit who can see this bar by their access level. For more information on this, please see \nthis page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Phone Required\n\n\nIf this option is set to Yes, all users will be required to have a cell phone listed on their account. If a user does not have a cell phone, they will be required to provide one when logging in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enrollment (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThis feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location. \n\n\n\n\nEnable Enrollment Options\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Link Text\n\n\nThis will be the button or link in the Enrollment email that the user will click on to proceed to a registration form to enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email\n\n\nThis will appear to the end user as the 'From' email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Subject\n\n\nEnter the Subject of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Top\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the top of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Bottom\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the bottom of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base \nHERE\n. \n\n\n Location Settings\n\n\nHere you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an admin attempts to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.\n\n\nThe Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.\n\n\nTypically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information. \n\n\n LightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThe LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)\n\n\nThere are two tiers to the LightPad. The first is a simple way for your end users to contact Support.\n\n\nThe second is a way for users to 'Ask the Expert' \n\n\n\n\nEnable LightPad Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn off or on the LightPad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad From Address\n\n\nThis field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LightPad Support Yes/No\n\n\nThis feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support Title\n\n\nThis is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Button Name\n \n\n\nThis is the name of the button users click to send a message to support.

This text appears on the page where the user sends the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Message Delivery Options\n\n\nThese settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System. \n\n\nOnce these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a text message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email.

It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be activated under System Settings, and configured per location as desired.\n\n\n\n\nWatchdog Enabled Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the Watchdog reporting feature.

When you Create or Clone a Theme, it is automatically applied to the location, which will override the existing theme and replace it with basically a blank canvas. If there are any Users at that location, they will see the changes immediately. So again - CREATE A NEW LOCATION first, where you can build and test how your theme looks without affecting any live users.\n\n\nAfter your Theme has been created to your liking, you can easily apply that theme to any location.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Creating or Managing a Theme\n\n\nThe Theme Editor can be found on the Super User Dashboard, under 403 - Theme Management. Once there, select your System (typically you will only have one System to choose from.)\n\n\nEvery System has a Main System Theme - that is the theme you are logged into right now. You can either choose to edit your existing main theme, or you can create or clone new themes for your existing locations. \n\n\nPart 1: Creating a New Theme (Or CLONE and existing Theme)\n\n\nThe first thing you may want to do to begin learning the Themer would be to CLONE your existing theme into a new location you have created exclusively for building/testing.\n\n\nTo clone your existing theme, click on the \"Clone Theme\" button next to your system theme. Once the dialogue box appears, select which location to clone this theme to. Remember to be careful to only clone this theme to your testing location - as you could overwrite a LIVE location with theme settings that are not intended.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nWhen you CLONE a theme, our system will automatically duplicate every setting EXCEPT the Menus (Which are located under the Components menu at the top) Once your theme is cloned you'll want to visit the Components menu and add your menu items.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a New Theme\n\n\nThe following sections cover each area of the Themer. We include \"Example\" settings for a default theme that you could build as an exercise to get to know the themer a bit better. The exercise would take you about 20 minutes to complete. \n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nWhen you first click on Create Theme the first thing you should do is hit the SAVE button. This is required before the theme will officially be created.\n\n\nAfter you click SAVE you will see the screen update to some basic/default colors - this is because as you update each field, you will see the colors and images appear in real time around you in the Themer. \n\n\nPart 2: Menu Options and Naming your theme\n\n\nIn the top navigation we have three options: \n\n\n\n\nNavigate back to \u201cLocation Selection\u201d\n\n\nThis is where you just came from, this section will allow you to select a different theme to create/clone/edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Editor (what we're in now)\n\n\nThis section controls the main settings for your theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nThis section controls the Main Menu Carousel and other Menus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the header area you can change the name of your theme, and view how many locations this theme is currently assigned to. \n\n\nClicking on the number will take you back to \u201cLocation Selection\u201d where it will display all of the locations using this theme.\n\n\nRenaming your theme: If you are working with a lot of Themes it would be best to name this something unique - naming it \u201cTheme 2\u201d might be confusing down the line.\n\n\nPart 3: Start Themeing\n\n\nIn some areas of the Themer you are required to upload images - for demo purposes we provide some example default imagery that you can use for your theme.\n\n\nDownload all default images.\n\n\nAlmost all of the image sizes below can vary depending on how you design your Theme. The following sizes are not REQUIRED but are a good starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Reference - Default Image Sizes:\n\n\nExample Filename\n\n\nSize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo (This will vary based on your own Logo)\n\n\nvts_logo.png\n\n\n438x94\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader Background\n\n\nheader_background.png\n\n\n2000x156\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation Bar Foreground\n\n\nnav_bar_foreground.png\n\n\n940x48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamburger Menu Background\n\n\nhamburger_menu_background.jpg\n\n\n2000x294\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamburger Menu Layered/Foreground\n\n\nhamburger_menu_background_layered.png\n\n\n2000x250\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Menu Background\n\n\nmain_menu_bg.jpg\n\n\n950x432\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Background\n\n\npage_background.jpg\n\n\n2000x1239\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Background Layered\n\n\npage_bg_layered.png\n\n\n2000x1200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Background\n\n\ncontent_background.jpg\n\n\n950x585\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Background\n\n\nfooter_background1.png\n\n\n940x2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Center Background\n\n\ntraining_center_background.jpg\n\n\n950x585\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Override Logo\n\n\nheader_logo.png\n\n\n219x47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft and Right Menu Tile\n\n\nright and left_menu_tile.png\n\n\n174x130\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support\n\n\nsupport-generic.png\n\n\n120x120\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarousel Menu - Panel Background\n\n\npanel_background.png\n\n\n512x304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarousel Menu - Panel Foreground\n\n\npanel_001 through 004.png\n\n\n378x232\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: The Header\n\n\nThe Header section contains two sub-sections: Logo and Header. The header is visible on ALL screens in the system at all times.\n\n\nLogo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo:\n\n\nvts_logo.png [438x94]\n\n\nThe size of your Logo may vary from our example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Logo Width:\n\n\n219\n\n\nForce the Width for your logo (leaving this blank will default to your image width)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Logo Height:\n\n\n47\n\n\nForce the Height for your logo (leaving this blank will default to your image height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo Y Position:\n\n\n38\n\n\nThis is the up and down position of the Logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo X Position:\n\n\n356\n\n\nThis is the left and right position of the Logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nYou'll want to manipulate the logo data above based on the size of your own logo. You can change the position of the logo by manipulating the Y and X fields (Y for up and down, X for left and right.) In our example we wanted to display the logo in the center of the screen.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHeader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Text Color:\n\n\n#222222\n\n\nThis is the color of the Location Name found at the top right of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader Height:\n\n\n156\n\n\nYou can manipulate this height based on your needs - for example, if your logo is very tall you would want to increase this number to a more suitable one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Color:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nFor this Theme we are leaving this field blank because we have an image covering the entirety of the header already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Image:\n\n\nheader_background.png [2000x156]\n\n\nWe match the height of this image to our Header Height field. We included the 'navigation' bar imagery in this so we could simply lay the buttons on top of it (in Section 2), but this is entirely optional - you can add a navigation bar image later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Repeat:\n\n\nrepeat-x\n\n\nThis property defines how the background image is repeated. This is a commonly used CSS setting that you will see throughout the Themer. Here your options are: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat, initial, and inherit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Size:\n\n\n2000px auto\n\n\nSet the width of your background and then whether or not to adjust the size. The available options are: auto, length, percentage, cover, contain, initial, and inherit. Again these are typical CSS settings you will find throughout the Themer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Position:\n\n\ncenter top\n\n\nYour available options here are: left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, center top, center center, center bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Margin:\n\n\n17\n\n\nThis is the distance between the bottom of the Header and the top of the Main Page. Because of the design of our header we added an additional 17 pixels to push the main page down a bit. We could have also changed the \"Header Height\" field to 173, and left this field 0, to achieve the same result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Main Navigation\n\n\nThe Main Navigation section covers the main navigation bar buttons (What the buttons will look like - NOT what will actually go here.), the search button, and the header area behind the buttons. \n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nThe versatility of the themer allows us to make different design decisions, like in the Main Navigation bar in our example here. What we decided to do was include the artwork for the navigation bar in the Header section above. We then decided to lay a \"Foreground\" image on TOP of that image to show separation between the buttons. We could have just as easily included this image in the Header section and omitted the image in this section.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nMain Navigation Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Color:\n\n\n#ffffff\n\n\nThis controls the color of the text in the buttons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Shadow:\n\n\nnone\n\n\nThis is another commonly used CSS setting, the available options are: h-shadow, v-shadow, blur-radius, color, none, initial, inherit. You can use many of them in combination, for example: h-shadow, v-shadow, blur-radius and color would look like this in the field: \"2px 2px 8px #FF0000\" That would give us a shadow 2 pixels horizontal, 2 pixels vertical (so down and to the right) with an 8px blur radius (less pixels here of course would make the shadow more sharp) and a color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 1:\n\n\ntransparent\n\n\nThis sets the top-half color of the button when it is not being hovered over. In our example we are not using this so we've entered \"transparent.\" If you want to set a color, use the hex color code format - for example: #ffffff would be white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 2:\n\n\ntransparent\n\n\nThis is the bottom-half part of the color set above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder Color:\n\n\ntransparent\n\n\nThis is the border color of the static button. Again as we chose not to use the button, we are leaving this transparent. When using this, you would use RGBA here - enter: rgba(0,0,0,0) for transparent to see how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Color Hover:\n\n\n#000000\n\n\nThis is the color of the text when it is being hovered over. In our example we're using White, so the black text appears white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Shadow Hover:\n\n\nnone\n\n\nThis is for the shadow of the text upon hovering over it. The settings for this field are the same as the \"Text Shadow\" field above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 1 Hover:\n\n\n#ffffff\n\n\nHere you can set the top-half color of the Hover state of the button. In our example we use White on the top and Grey on the bottom to create a nice effect. Because we're using a White Hover color, when our text color is already White, we made sure to flip the text to Black (The setting above) so the text would still show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 2 Hover:\n\n\n#d5d5d5\n\n\nThis is the bottom-half color of the Hover state of the button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder Color Hover:\n\n\nrgba(255,255,255,1)\n\n\nThis is the border color of the hover button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorner Radius:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nHere you can modify the corner radius of the buttons. Leaving this blank will produce an almost square look, while entering 20px will give you almost a half circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton Height:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nThis will increase your button height, leaving this blank will default to 1.8em. Warning: Do not try a size lower than 1.8, as it will cause issues on some screens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton Side Padding:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nThis will increase the width of the button in addition to the text inside the button. Leaving this blank will default the size to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton Margin (Right):\n\n\n23\n\n\nThis is used to align the buttons horizontally into the correct position. In our example we enter 23, as this is 23 pixels from the 'left' boundary of the navigation area to help align our buttons correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nThis section is only for the \"styling\" of the buttons. You can Add, Remove or Manipulate the actual buttons under the Components -> Menus section.\n\n\n\nAfter these first few sections you may notice a pattern emerging. Any time there is a button to style it will contain the same basic elements - so if your theme uses the same look and feel for all of the buttons, you can speed right through the next few areas using the same data. In our example we use slightly different settings for each area. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nMain Navigation Search Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIcon Color:\n\n\n#cacaca\n\n\nThis sets the color of the magnifying glass icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 1:\n\n\n#434343\n\n\nThis color will make up the top-half color of the button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 2:\n\n\n#000000\n\n\nThis color will make up the bottom-half color of the button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder Color:\n\n\nrgba(67,67,67,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIcon Color Hover:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nThis field and the next 2 accepts hex color code format, such as: #ffffff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 1 Hover:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient Color 2 Hover:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder Color Hover:\n\n\nrgba(255,255,255,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Navigation Search Drop Down:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIcon Color:\n\n\n#205b97\n\n\nThis sets the color of the icon located in the search drop down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Navigation UI - this controls the header bar / image that sits behind the buttons (above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNav Y Position:\n\n\n108\n\n\nThis is where your buttons and Foreground Image will line up on the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Color:\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nHere you can add a solid color to use as the background of the navigation bar.

Header Height:  156  You can manipulate this height based on your needs - for example, if your logo is very tall you would want to increase this number to a more suitable one.    Background Color:  n/a  For this Theme we are leaving this field blank because we have an image covering the entirety of the header already.    Background Image:  header_background.png [2000x156]  We match the height of this image to our Header Height field. We included the 'navigation' bar imagery in this so we could simply lay the buttons on top of it (in Section 2), but this is entirely optional - you can add a navigation bar image later on.    Background Repeat:  repeat-x  This property defines how the background image is repeated. This is a commonly used CSS setting that you will see throughout the Themer. Here your options are: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat, initial, and inherit.    Background Size:  2000px auto  Set the width of your background and then whether or not to adjust the size. The available options are: auto, length, percentage, cover, contain, initial, and inherit. Again these are typical CSS settings you will find throughout the Themer.    Background Position:  center top  Your available options here are: left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom, center top, center center, center bottom.    Bottom Margin:  17  This is the distance between the bottom of the Header and the top of the Main Page. Because of the design of our header we added an additional 17 pixels to push the main page down a bit.

What we decided to do was include the artwork for the navigation bar in the Header section above. We then decided to lay a \"Foreground\" image on TOP of that image to show separation between the buttons. We could have just as easily included this image in the Header section and omitted the image in this section.",

            "text": "Setting  Example  Notes      Text Color:  #ffffff  This controls the color of the text in the buttons.    Text Shadow:  none  This is another commonly used CSS setting, the available options are: h-shadow, v-shadow, blur-radius, color, none, initial, inherit. You can use many of them in combination, for example: h-shadow, v-shadow, blur-radius and color would look like this in the field: \"2px 2px 8px #FF0000\" That would give us a shadow 2 pixels horizontal, 2 pixels vertical (so down and to the right) with an 8px blur radius (less pixels here of course would make the shadow more sharp) and a color.    Gradient Color 1:  transparent  This sets the top-half color of the button when it is not being hovered over. In our example we are not using this so we've entered \"transparent.\" If you want to set a color, use the hex color code format - for example: #ffffff would be white.    Gradient Color 2:  transparent  This is the bottom-half part of the color set above.    Border Color:  transparent  This is the border color of the static button. Again as we chose not to use the button, we are leaving this transparent. When using this, you would use RGBA here - enter: rgba(0,0,0,0) for transparent to see how it works.    Text Color Hover:  #000000  This is the color of the text when it is being hovered over. In our example we're using White, so the black text appears white.    Text Shadow Hover:  none  This is for the shadow of the text upon hovering over it. The settings for this field are the same as the \"Text Shadow\" field above.    Gradient Color 1 Hover:  #ffffff  Here you can set the top-half color of the Hover state of the button. In our example we use White on the top and Grey on the bottom to create a nice effect. Because we're using a White Hover color, when our text color is already White, we made sure to flip the text to Black (The setting above) so the text would still show up.    Gradient Color 2 Hover:  #d5d5d5  This is the bottom-half color of the Hover state of the button.    Border Color Hover:  rgba(255,255,255,1)  This is the border color of the hover button.    Corner Radius:  n/a  Here you can modify the corner radius of the buttons. Leaving this blank will produce an almost square look, while entering 20px will give you almost a half circle.    Button Height:  n/a  This will increase your button height, leaving this blank will default to 1.8em. Warning: Do not try a size lower than 1.8, as it will cause issues on some screens.    Button Side Padding:  n/a  This will increase the width of the button in addition to the text inside the button. Leaving this blank will default the size to 0.    Button Margin (Right):  23  This is used to align the buttons horizontally into the correct position. In our example we enter 23, as this is 23 pixels from the 'left' boundary of the navigation area to help align our buttons correctly.     \n     \n        Tip\n     \n     \nThis section is only for the \"styling\" of the buttons. You can Add, Remove or Manipulate the actual buttons under the Components -> Menus section. \nAfter these first few sections you may notice a pattern emerging. Any time there is a button to style it will contain the same basic elements - so if your theme uses the same look and feel for all of the buttons, you can speed right through the next few areas using the same data. In our example we use slightly different settings for each area.",

Content Roles are the actual \u201cRoles\u201d that are assigned to users on the front end. A User can be assigned as many Content Roles as needed.\n\n\nHere is a corny yesteryear analogy in hopes to help understand how Categories and Content Roles are used to control how users see Courses. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1995 and you are going into a video rental store. All of the DVD movies (and maybe even some VHS tapes back in 1995) are \u201cCourses\u201d and each section of the store is a \u201cCategory.\u201d There are sections like; Comedy, Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance, etc. So the entire store is like a  Content Container, and each of the sections that you can browse in the store are your \u201cCategories.\u201d But now you also have the ability to have these \u201cContent Roles\u201d which can limit, or determine what movies you see in each section. Let\u2019s say you are a Kevin Bacon fan and thus you are a member of a Content Role called \u201dSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\u201d And now, if you are part of that Content Role, you would only see movies with Kevin Bacon in them (or someone that is six degrees of Kevin Bacon), as you browse through each section of your store.\n\n\n\n\nOkay back to the technical stuff. You can create as many Content Roles in your Content Container as you want to, and put as many Courses in each one as you want to also. You can put the same Course in multiple Content Roles if needed too. You can also add a description for each Content Role, so that when you are seeing them on the front end, you can see these descriptions to better describe what type of Courses are in these Content Roles. There is also the ability to \u2018rank\u2019 the Content Roles too. This is important, as this is the sort order that these Content Roles appear on the front end of the System, when you are assigning them to users.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201cContent Roles\u201d tab in the Content Container. Here is a walk through of the screenshot below, and some information on each item that you can edit.\n\n\n\n\n1...  This is where you create new Content Roles. You can specify here if you want to create it as \u2018Standard\u2019 or Premium.\u2019 If you know it is intended to be a Premium Content Role, this saves you some time here, as it will automatically mark it as \u201cPremium\u201d on ALL Locations right now (and save you the step to do that later\u2026 but you can always change your mind and do it later too).\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nNext to each Content Role name, you will see it\u2019s ID# in a bracket, such as [2563] in this example. Everything in the LSVT System has a unique ID# - be it a System, a Theme, a Location, a Course, a Content Role, etc. - and they are always indicated in a \u201cbracket\u201d like that. This helps you identify them with a unique ID# as well as these ID#\u2019s are used in some of the more advanced config areas of the System as you learn more about them.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n2... Here is a list of all of your Content Roles. You can see the name and the description you gave them. This name and description is also seen by users on the front end, so name and describe them carefully. They aren\u2019t marked \u2018Standard\u2019 or \u2018Premium\u2019 here, because one Content Role may be \u2018Standard\u2019 at one Location, but \u2018Premium\u2019 at another, and we\u2019ll get in to that shortly.\n\n\n3... Here is where it shows the \u2018Rank\u2019 which determines the sort order that they appear on the front end. You can also see the total number of Courses within a each Content Role (click that number and a pop-up dialog will appear showing you the list of Courses by name) and also a link to \u201cmanage\u201d\u2019 the Courses within that Content Role, which is where you can add and subtract Courses within that Content Role as needed.\nIf you click the \u2018name\u2019 of the Content Role, you can administrate some further details about it - let\u2019s take a look at that next.\n\n\n\n\n4... In the top area you can see the number of Courses assigned to this Content Role and the number of users that are also assigned to it. Each of those numbers can be clicked to view the list of each.\n\n\n5... In this area you can edit the name of your Content Role, update the Description of it, make it Inactive if you are wanting to turn it off, and also change the Rank easily too.\n\n\n Standard vs. Premium Content Roles\n\n\nA Premium Role is a Content Role that is not visible to be added/selected in the User's profile by standard overseers or managers, but can be added/selected by a Top Admin. This may be useful where there is \"Premium Content\" that can be purchased by individual users at a location, and by it being a Premium Content Role, a Manager at that location cannot assign this Premium content to a user without oversight by a Top Admin, or a paid transaction. By a paid transaction, I mean that if there is content that can be purchased via an ecommerce transaction, it may be contained in a Premium Content Role, so that standard users and managers cannot add it on their own, without making the purchase or transaction.\n\n\nThe Premium Content Roles will also allow for you to hide desired Content Roles at desired Locations, as it is a \"Per Location\" Setting. What this means is that if you have some Content Roles that are only applicable for a certain number of Locations and not all Locations, this gives you the ability to \"hide\" these sensitive Content Roles as needed from certain Locations.\n\n\nIf you have access to Premium Content, you can view and modify this content in two areas:\nThe first area is in the tab in the Content Container area called \u201c\u2018Premium\u2019 Content, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the first two columns list your Location ID#\u2019s and Names, then each Content Role is listed with a \u2018check box\u2019 to allow you to indicate any desired Content Role to be \u2018Premium\u2019 at that specific Location. In my example above, the \u2018Gold Package\u2019 is a Content Role that I have marked as \u2018Premium\u2019 at all of my Locations.\n\n\nThe second area that Premium Content Roles are visible is when you are using the \"Manage Users\" tool at a Location, or in the Super User Dashboard. When you select a user to edit their profile, you will see a section below the \"Standard Content\" section where you can add or remove \"Premium\" content.\nIn the screenshot below, you can see the entire Content Role area that you would see on each user\u2019s profile, and which ones from our examples above are Standard vs. Premium. I am seeing the Premium Content Roles because \n\n\nI am viewing it as a Top Admin with that privilege. A regular Overseer (or Manager) at this Location would only see the Standard Content Roles.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see in the example screenshot above, that this user is set to two of the Content Roles, so that when they go to the Training Center, they will see the Courses that are inside those two Content Roles, in whatever Categories that those Courses are in.\n\n\nContent Roles will be a big part of the conversation about Administering your System in a lot of areas, and we will go into more detail in each area where they have different settings that apply to different things, so we\u2019ll be talking about them in many places throughout these Help Docs.\n\n\n Role and Access Mapping\n\n\nThis is the other tab that is available within the Content Container feature. This is a very powerful tool to map Content Roles to users post launch. As you add new Content Roles, you will likely need to map them to existing users, or even change how some existing Content Roles are assigned, and this is a very flexible tool that gives you several options to do this.\n\n\nThere are three mapping tools for you to use:\n\n\n1... \nMap an Access Level to another Access Level\n\n\nThis will Re-Assign all users at the selected System assigned to one Access Level to a different/new Access Level. You can also specify which specific Locations, or ALL Locations. This would remove Access Level \"X\" from all users and make them the new Access Level \"Y.\"\n\n\nThis is helpful if you decide to change your Access Levels post launch, and you have a bunch of users already in use. You can use this tool to migrate them to a different Access Level if needed.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n2... \nMap One or More Content Roles to an Access Level\n\n\nThis is helpful if you have a new Content Role, and know exactly what type of user will need it, based on their current Access Level. Or, do the inverse, and remove a Content Role.\nFirst, specify which specific Locations, or ALL Locations.\n\n\nThen select whether you want to \u201cAdd\u201d - \u201cRemove\u201d or \u201cAdd and Replace\u201d a list of Content Roles, based on a user's Access Level.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nThis tool is handy if you want to completely remove an existing Content Role from everything. You can remove it from each Access Level, one at a time, and unassign it from basically \u201call\u201d users, as a Content Role won't let you make it Inactive if it has ANY users still assigned to it.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n3... \nMap One or More Content Roles to an existing Content Role\n\n\nThis is similar to the one we just talked about, but this one is helpful if you have a new Content Role, and know exactly what type of user will need it, based on one of their current Content Roles (vs. Access Level). Or, do the inverse and remove a Content Role.\n\n\nSee the screenshot below as a reference.",

Content Roles are the actual \u201cRoles\u201d that are assigned to users on the front end. A User can be assigned as many Content Roles as needed.  Here is a corny yesteryear analogy in hopes to help understand how Categories and Content Roles are used to control how users see Courses. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1995 and you are going into a video rental store. All of the DVD movies (and maybe even some VHS tapes back in 1995) are \u201cCourses\u201d and each section of the store is a \u201cCategory.\u201d There are sections like; Comedy, Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance, etc. So the entire store is like a  Content Container, and each of the sections that you can browse in the store are your \u201cCategories.\u201d But now you also have the ability to have these \u201cContent Roles\u201d which can limit, or determine what movies you see in each section. Let\u2019s say you are a Kevin Bacon fan and thus you are a member of a Content Role called \u201dSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\u201d And now, if you are part of that Content Role, you would only see movies with Kevin Bacon in them (or someone that is six degrees of Kevin Bacon), as you browse through each section of your store.   Okay back to the technical stuff. You can create as many Content Roles in your Content Container as you want to, and put as many Courses in each one as you want to also. You can put the same Course in multiple Content Roles if needed too. You can also add a description for each Content Role, so that when you are seeing them on the front end, you can see these descriptions to better describe what type of Courses are in these Content Roles.

This is simply to make it easy for you to find and use these videos at a future time. We will put a \u201cLast Modified\u201d stamp on each video in your Media Library as well to assist you for future reference.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nOnce you have added video to your Media Library, you can swap out the actual video at a future time, however, this in itself will not add/replace this new video to any Chapters or areas that have used the prior video. You will still need to navigate to that desired chapter and update it to use the newer video from this Media Library entry. This is a fail-safe to ensure you don\u2019t add/update anything unintentionally.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Encoding Settings\n\n\nWhen encoding videos, you will want to have as high quality video as you can to start with - the ole\u2019 Garbage In = Garbage Out analogy. Below are some answers to commonly asked questions about this process to best assist you in making your video look the best it can.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat video format should my source video be?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nPretty much anything that is \u201creally\u201d a video. \nCLICK HERE\n to jump down this page and take a detailed look at acceptable video formats.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat resolution or size should my video be?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nWe playback videos at a 16:9 ratio, ideally 1280 (width) by 720 (height). However any size of 16:9 will scale in fine. If your video is not a 16:9 ratio, we will help you and add a \u201cpad\u201d around it to fill up the space to that ratio. We don\u2019t goof up your video by stretching it to an odd size that looks bad.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nHow long will it take to encode my video?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nThat depends how fast your Internet upload speed is to upload it, and then also how long (in duration) your video is to encode it.\n\n\nThe basic process is:\n\n\n\n\nWe will upload your video, and you will see a progress bar on this process. A five minute video typically takes less than 30 seconds to upload.\n\n\nWe will encode your video to all of the different target formats to be compatible across desktop and mobile formats. A five minute video typically takes about three minutes to encode.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Do not close the pop up window until the file has completed uploading and processing.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat type of video player do we use?\n\n\nANSWER:\n\nIt isn't any \"type\" of video player - it is our \"Custom VT Player\" which uses some industry standard elements, and then added a lot of customizations that are specific to our System. \n\n\n\n    \n\n        Tip\n    \n\n    \n\nWhen you are adding video to the Media Library, a small window will pop open to indicate the process of that one video uploading and encoding. You can navigate your main window back to the Media Library and upload a second (or more) videos in additional pop up windows. When they are done uploading and encoding they will save back to the Media Library on their own for convenience.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Encoding Output Specifics\n\n\nOnce you upload your source video, we will encode it to these different formats for adaptive streaming, and we will \u201cAuto\u201d select the right one for the user, based on your available bandwidth and/or device, dynamically during playback. Additionally, advanced users may use the \"gear icon\" ( \n ) on the video player to indicate their preferred format, and override the \u201cAuto\u201d setting.\n\n\nThe width and height measurements noted below are used as the maximum values for the resize, preserving aspect ratio. So if you wanted to resize a 300x400 video into 100x100, the resulting video would be 75x100 pixels.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note - Is Your Video High Definition?\n    \n\n    \n\nWhen you are uploading your video, we ask - \u201cIs Your Video High Definition?\u201d If you select \u201cYes\u201d then we will utilize the 720p HD encoding settings, as well as all of the others. If you select \u201cNo\u201d we will use 480p and below.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Streaming (also known as HLS) / m3u8 - Output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth\n\n\nHeight\n\n\nBitrate\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1280\n\n\n720\n\n\n1500k\n\n\n720p HD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n854\n\n\n480\n\n\n800k\n\n\n480p High\n\n\n\n\n\n\n640\n\n\n360\n\n\n400k\n\n\n360p Med\n\n\n\n\n\n\n432\n\n\n240\n\n\n200k\n\n\n240p Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMp4 - Outputs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth\n\n\nHeight\n\n\nBitrate\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n768\n\n\n432\n\n\n1200k\n\n\nMp4 - Mobile High\n\n\n\n\n\n\n640\n\n\n360\n\n\n960k\n\n\nMp4 - Mobile Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMp3 - Output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Rate\n\n\nBitrate\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44100 Hz\n\n\n256k\n\n\nMp3 - Audio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster Image / JPG - Output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth\n\n\nHeight\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n768\n\n\n432\n\n\nPoster Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The Poster Image is automatically generated at the 2 second mark of the Video.\n\n\n What format of videos can you upload?\n\n\nThe Media Library can accept any format of video that you upload, that is indeed a video (a Powerpoint file is not a video, no matter how many \u201ccool\u201d slide transitions you know how to make - nor is an Animated GIF... sorry).\n\n\nCommon acceptable formats you can upload are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffix\n\n\nType\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.MP4\n\n\nMPEG-4\n\n\nMost common format right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.MOV\n\n\nQuickTime\n\n\nFile format Created commonly by Apple computers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.MPG\n\n\nMPEG-1 and MPEG-2\n\n\nOlder format, but still widely used.

            "text": "When encoding videos, you will want to have as high quality video as you can to start with - the ole\u2019 Garbage In = Garbage Out analogy. Below are some answers to commonly asked questions about this process to best assist you in making your video look the best it can.  QUESTION: \nWhat video format should my source video be?  ANSWER: \nPretty much anything that is \u201creally\u201d a video.  CLICK HERE  to jump down this page and take a detailed look at acceptable video formats.  QUESTION: \nWhat resolution or size should my video be?  ANSWER: \nWe playback videos at a 16:9 ratio, ideally 1280 (width) by 720 (height). However any size of 16:9 will scale in fine. If your video is not a 16:9 ratio, we will help you and add a \u201cpad\u201d around it to fill up the space to that ratio. We don\u2019t goof up your video by stretching it to an odd size that looks bad.  QUESTION: \nHow long will it take to encode my video?  ANSWER: \nThat depends how fast your Internet upload speed is to upload it, and then also how long (in duration) your video is to encode it.  The basic process is:   We will upload your video, and you will see a progress bar on this process. A five minute video typically takes less than 30 seconds to upload.  We will encode your video to all of the different target formats to be compatible across desktop and mobile formats. A five minute video typically takes about three minutes to encode.   Note:  Do not close the pop up window until the file has completed uploading and processing.  QUESTION: \nWhat type of video player do we use?  ANSWER: \nIt isn't any \"type\" of video player - it is our \"Custom VT Player\" which uses some industry standard elements, and then added a lot of customizations that are specific to our System.   \n     \n        Tip\n     \n     \nWhen you are adding video to the Media Library, a small window will pop open to indicate the process of that one video uploading and encoding.

The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.\n\n\nWhen your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users within it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately be available for your end users to see.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\n\u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Upload your videos into the Media Library\n\nThe Media Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Media Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.\n\n\nStep 2: Assemble your videos into Courses\n\nOnce you have one or more videos in the Media Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Media Library first). These videos will also be added to the Media Library for you automatically.\n\n\nStep 3: Add your courses to Content Roles\n\nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d ... all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.\n\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you set up your content like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role\n\n\nContent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Strategies\n\n\nThis has courses on Sales training AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nThis has courses on mandatory Compliance training AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront Desk Training\n\n\nThis has courses on How To Run the Front Desk AND New Hire Orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from this example that all 3 roles have their own unique content, as well as sharing the \"New Hire Orientation\" content. \n\n\nStep 4: Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location\n\nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.\n\n\nStep 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired\n\nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are Active at their Location.\n\n\nIn the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being inactive and they are grayed out.\n\n\nYou will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. \n\n\n\n\nHere is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d\n\n\nYou can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.\n\n\nHere is a visual representation of that example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Role Name\n\n\nCourses in this Role\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nCompliance, New Hire Orientation, AND California ONLY Compliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Location Course Settings\n\n\nCourse Active?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance - California Only\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Location Course Settings\n\n\nCourse Active?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance - California Only\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, a user could have the Compliance content role, and still only see the content that they are assigned, because the course is not active at their location.\n\n\nThis flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.\n\n\n\n\n Categories\n\n\nThis section will help you create a new Category. A category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Training Center before you hover over a category tile with your cursor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a cursor rolling over the center Category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, there are two images for the center Category. One thumbnail, and one rollover thumbnail.\n\n\nOkay let's dive into Courseware Management - After you have selected your content container, you can either select \nCategory List\n, where you can \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n.\n\n\nWhen you click on the \nCategory List\n option, if you have any existing categories they will be displayed like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatID\n\n\nRank\n\n\nCategory Name\n\n\nInternal Desc.\n\n\nCourses Assigned To\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a unique identifier for this Category.\n\n\nThis is order in which this category will display in the Training Center. (Lower the rank, higher it will display)\n\n\nThis is the name of the Category.\n\n\nThis is an area for internal notes only, the end-user will never see this text.\n\n\nThis is a list of Courses, with their Course ID, that are currently assigned to this Category.\n\n\nIf the Category is active, it will be checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Create or Edit a Category - Basic Info\n\n\nOnce you click into a Category, or add a new one, you can add or edit the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not display for anyone until you complete the very last step of the activation process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: Auto Ranks\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Category in Training Center Root\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle only affects VT2GO content. This toggle will show or hide this category at the home/root level in the app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Type\n - \nStandard or List of Links\n\n\nA category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\". A \"List of Links\" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. You may use the \"List of Links\" Category Type to add additional organization layers to your Training Center. \"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category. Please \nCLICK HERE\n to see more information about your Training Center Hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Name\n - \nRequired Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Category Name in the Training Center\n  - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the name of this Category in the Training Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nHere you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device. After you have selected an image from your local device, and hit 'save', the thumbnail will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail Roll Over (Optional)\n - \nThis can be left blank\n\n\nHere you can enter the path to the category rollover image, OR choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen to Thumbnail\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThe \"Yes\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"No\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen = Yes\n\n\nAdd Sheen = No\n\n\nCharlie Sheen = Winning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Warning - File Size Best Practices\n    \n\n    \n\nLSVT does not compress or resize your images. Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep the file size low, and use the correct dimensions, when uploading these thumbnails. For example, if you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Category - Additional Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the description of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is an Internal view for you only.

To add more Content Roles now, click on \"Content Containers\" in the top navigation bar now. We cover Content Containers and Roles in the \nContent Containers\n section of these Help Docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n Chapters\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part consists of either an .m3u8 Playlist (for Adaptive Streaming) or an .mp4 file (for Progressive).\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nOnly a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA chapter with a test can be followed by a \"Recap\". A \"Recap\" can be text or video, that will play if the user fails to pass the test. This is optional, however it is recommended you include this for each chapter. (In some scenarios, if you have a 10 minute chapter, and the user fails the test, it is a better user experience to have the user review a brief recap, 1-2 minutes, rather than go through the entire 10 minute video again)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n while editing an existing \ncourse\n. The \"Chapters\" section will become active after you have saved and created your course.\n\n\n\n\n Create or Edit a Chapter - Basic Info\n\n\nFirst decide which type of chapter this is. There are 4 basic types:\n\n\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss each in detail below.\n\n\nBegin by filling The Rank, Chapter Name and Chapter Type. Pay special attention to the warning messages here, they're very important to be able to navigate further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter. The system will populate a default rank 1 higher than the previous chapter automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Name\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Type:\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \"default\" test summary Navigation buttons\n\n\nIn chapter type 1, 2 and 4, you have the option to show or hide the automatic navigation buttons. If set to yes, navigation buttons will appear on the test summary screen directing the user to either move on to the next course, or visit the course menu to select new content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This friendly warning you may have seen already, but it's there to remind you to save your work!\n\n\n This friendly note is letting you know that you must SAVE the chapter before adding any test questions. (You can't add test questions to something that doesn't exist! By saving the chapter, you are \"creating\" it in our database, and therefore we have something to attach the test questions to.)\n\n\n You can see here the \"Test Settings\" section is grayed out. As soon as you hit Save it will be accessible!\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at the different chapter types.\n\n\n Chapter - Standard (Video and Test)\n\n\nIn a Standard chapter type, the chapter must have at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nIf you've already uploaded and encoded your video file, you can add that now by clicking on \n\"+ Add Chapter Part\"\n and selecting the file path from your Media Library.\n\n\nIf you're still waiting for your files to upload and encode, you can come back to this section at any time and add your chapter part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Add Chapter Part\n\n\nClick on the \"Select From Library\" button and select a video to add to this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You'll notice now that we saved, the \"Test Settings\" link is no longer grayed out.\n\n\n We still cannot activate this chapter until we add at least 1 test question!\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nWe will be continuing with this section as if you already have a video ready to add to this Chapter. If you still need to upload and encode your video file(s), please check out our section on the \nMedia Library\n for tips and best practices.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Summary Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (This screen is displayed before the user starts the test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (This is seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. This could be the default message, or if it's the last chapter of a course you could direct the user to the next training content, or even add supplemental information such as a PDF download or link to a 3rd party site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (This is seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. This could be the default message, or words of encouragement, or hints as to how to pass the test, or anything really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also make available \"Default Text\" options in case you are unsure what to put here.\n\n\n Chapter - Social Settings\n\n\nPlease visit \nTHIS\n Knowledge Base article for more information on the Social Settings feature.\n\n\n Chapter - VT2GO Settings\n\n\nVT2GO settings are covered \nHERE\n.\n\n\n Chapter - Test Settings\n\n\nIn order to access the additional test settings we must enter our first test question. Currently the only available test type is \"Standard\" which is Multiple Choice. More test types are coming soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Add Question\n\n\nAdd a question, let's get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes. If you need to later turn this Question off you can do so here, or on the previous screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n. Otherwise it will still randomize all of your test questions even if a rank is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nThis is where you enter the test question text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in seconds, how long the question timer should be. We default the timer to 60 seconds. You may go as high as 999 seconds (which is about 16-17 minutes). If you enter \"0\" in the field, it will remove the timer altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Options (Select which answer is correct by checking the box)\n\n\nAnswer A is for the first possible test question answer. Answer B is the second option, and down the line to F. There can be 6 possible answers, but you are only required to use a minimum of 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Correct or Incorrect Answer Graphic\n - \nDefault: Checked\n\n\nThese checkboxes will be selected by default. If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n graphic pop-ups will not be active. Note: These must be checked in order for the text or video answer response action to appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected, then you can select that video from your library. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Text\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Settings\n\n\nAfter you have created your first question, navigate back to the \"Test Settings\" tab and you can now view and modify the additional settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then the system will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Sort Order\n - \nDefault: Random\n\n\nRandomize the questions: This will pull all of the test questions randomly.\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank: This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap\n\n\nIf you add a recap, and the user fails the test, then the user will be prompted to take the \nrecap\n before taking the test again. If they then fail the test a second time, they will have to take the training from the beginning of the chapter again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have added as many test questions as you need, remember now to activate your chapter and move on to the final activation steps!\n\n\n Chapter - Test Only\n\n\nIn a Test Only chapter type, the chapter will have no video parts, and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nYou will see that once you change the Chapter Type, the screen changes slightly. You no longer have the option to add a video to this chapter - as it is a test only.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Video only (With Auto Advance)\n\n\nIn a Video Only chapter type, the chapter will only have a video part, and no Summary or Test Question options.\n\n\nA chapter set to Auto Advance will automatically begin playing the next chapter once it is done. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Warning\n    \n\n    \n\nYour final chapter of your course CAN NOT be set to this chapter type, or it will cause an error. The system will have nothing to auto advance to once the course is completed!\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter - Video only (With Summary)\n\n\nThis is similar to the option above, however in this case you can add a Summary to give the user additional information, direct them to another area of the system, or to simply say congratulations before they move on to the next chapter.",

            "text": "Keywords\n     \n     \nDrop in, Drop-In, Content, Add Content, New Content, Upload, Upload Videos, Uploading\n       This article is an overview on how the \u201cCourseware Management\u201d area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.  When your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users within it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately be available for your end users to see.  \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \n\u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d\n        Step 1: Upload your videos into the Media Library \nThe Media Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Media Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.  Step 2: Assemble your videos into Courses \nOnce you have one or more videos in the Media Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Media Library first). These videos will also be added to the Media Library for you automatically.  Step 3: Add your courses to Content Roles \nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d ... all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.  For example, let\u2019s say you set up your content like this:     Content Role  Content      Sales Strategies  This has courses on Sales training AND New Hire Orientation    Compliance  This has courses on mandatory Compliance training AND New Hire Orientation    Front Desk Training  This has courses on How To Run the Front Desk AND New Hire Orientation     You can see from this example that all 3 roles have their own unique content, as well as sharing the \"New Hire Orientation\" content.   Step 4: Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location \nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.  Step 5: Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired \nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are Active at their Location.  In the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and we show two of the Courses as being inactive and they are grayed out.  You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role.    Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:  Let\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d  You can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.  Here is a visual representation of that example:     Content Role Name  Courses in this Role      Compliance  Compliance, New Hire Orientation, AND California ONLY Compliance        Regular Location Course Settings  Course Active?      Compliance  Yes    Compliance - California Only  No        California Location Course Settings  Course Active?      Compliance  No    Compliance - California Only  Yes     In this example, a user could have the Compliance content role, and still only see the content that they are assigned, because the course is not active at their location.  This flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.  \n     \n        Note\n     \n     \nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n       So, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find more details on each area below.",

It is currently configured via a JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) with specific properties and values which are documented below.\n\n\nThe workflow to make these from scratch needs to go in 6 steps.\n\n\nSTEP 1: Planning\n\n\nPlan it out and write your scripts.

It is currently configured via a JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) with specific properties and values which are documented below.  The workflow to make these from scratch needs to go in 6 steps.  STEP 1: Planning  Plan it out and write your scripts. You should first make a flowchart of what you want this interactive adventure to look like on paper, then write your scripts from that.  Here is a flowchart of our example:  Download  Here are the scripts from our example:  Download  STEP 2: Shoot the video  It is really like shooting any other video, except there are two specific things to remember.  1st - Fade in and Fade Out - only put a Fade in on the \u201cintro\u201d video, and only put a \u201cfade-out\u201d on the closing video.  2nd - Leave time for your loops when  you have buttons up for the user to select.  STEP 3: Upload your videos  This is a pretty simple step, just go in and upload them all to the Media Library, and then make note of the URL of each MP4, and cut and paste each one into a file that you can utilize in Step 4 below.  STEP 4: Make the JSON file  This is the most tricky step of the whole part, and still is not that bad.  First you need to gather all of your assets and information that you want to use, which will be:     Assets and Information       Paths  All of the paths to your needed videos, and a name for each one so you can reference it in the JSON file    Buttons  You will need the question text, the answer option text, the height and width of your button \u201chot spots\u201d and the on screen measurement of where the hot spots sit, as well as the minute   second count that you want the hot spots to become \u201chot.\u201d    Loop time  you want to know the minute   second count of where you want the loop back point to be.     We cover how to make the full JSON file in the next section.  STEP 5: Upload your JSON file  Upload it in the Media Library as a \u201cdocument,\u201d and clipboard the path to your JSON file in the media Library, this is what you will inset in the \u201cChapter Path\u201d instead of a video.  STEP 6: Insert your JSON file as the Chapter Part  In the Courseware Manager, go and find the Chapter in question, and you will want to manually add the path to this JSON file (as opposed to \u201cSelect From Library\u201d like you would a video).

If you're still unclear how to get this far - Check out the \n\"Courseware Management\"\n section and then come back here.\n\n\nOkay, you will first want to Super User to the Location where you want to Activate/Deactivate the Course(s) - the most common way is go to the Super User Dashboard, and use the \u201c102 - Location Management\u201d Tool - and search for the Location you want, and click on it so that you are Super User\u2019d to it. You\u2019ll double check you are in the correct Location by seeing the Location name on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nThen go to the \u201cLocation Settings\u201d - this button is located in the Quick Links menu that is tucked in to the top of every screen. Remember, now that you are Super User\u2019d to this specific Location, all of these Quick Links are tools and reports that are specific to this one Location only.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are in the Location Settings, click on the second tab, called \u201cCourse Activation.\u201d This will show you a list of all of the Categories and Courses from your Content Container. By checking (or unchecking) these boxes, you can turn these Courses ON or OFF for this one Location.\n\n\nThere are two different views available - List and Grid - click on the icons at the top right of the screen to change your view:\n\n\nList:\n\n\n\n\nGrid:\n\n\n\n\nTo Activate or Deactivate a category or course, simply click on the red square to Activate, and the green checkmark to Deactivate. (The red square and green checkmark represent what the course status is set to currently.)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A common Use Case could be that you just want to turn off a course everywhere, because it is perhaps old and you don\u2019t need on it anymore. To do that, you can make the Course Inactive in the Content Container area of the Super User Dashboard, and it will turn off everywhere on the planet that it is on.\n\n\n Bulk Content Activation/Deactivation\n\n\nYES! It is possible!\n\n\nThere are Admin tools to do bulk content activations and deactivations for lots of Locations at a time!

In this example below - our \"Starting\" Content Role is called \"Schedule 1 - Start.\" (example - if you are creating a Schedule that rolls content out by \"week\" - you may want to name this \"starting role\" - \"Week 1\" - but this is flexible for you to name it as needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse whatever means you need, to ensure the desired users have access to this Content Role - it can be through the \"Auto Populate Role ID's by Access Level\" or whatever you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Web Services/Scheduled Courses admin, configure a new schedule. Search for a group. It is suggested to search for groups that have \u201cUse Content Container\u201d checked. This will only return groups that have content containers already configured - as that is a requirement to use the Scheduler - you cannot use the Scheduler on a Group that is not using \"Content Containers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter choosing the group, name the scheduler and click \u201cAdd Scheduler\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created a \u201cScheduler\u201d, you will be shown a table that contains all available Content Roles that could be added to the schedule. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Define the \"Starting\" Content Role\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to drag and drop the desired Content Role to the \u201cStarting Content Role\u201d row on top of tables. This will let the Scheduler know that every user that have that initial role assigned to them, will be part of the this Schedule- it will display in Orange, as in the screen shot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Specifying the rest of the Content Roles to \"roll out\"\n\n\n\n\nYou then need to drag and drop the remaining courses into the \u201cContent Roles in Schedule\u201d table in the order you wish them to appear, they will turn Green, as shown in the screen shot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach content role will get turned on according to the \u201cDefault Time Interval\u201d (Example: 1 week). The time interval uses the user's \"starting date\" as base for schedule. For example: If second role is set to 1 week, then the second role would be turned on 1 week after the user's starting date. Third role would be 1 week + 1 week after start date, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also override the default time interval for each role. For example, if the 2nd role is set to 5 days, then it would get turned on 1 week (because the 1st Content Role has no value in the \"Time Interval\" it will use the default value of \"1-week\") + 5 days (set for 2nd role) from the user's \"Start Date\" - then the 3rd Content Role will turn on 1 week after the 2nd, as it has no value set, and will use the \"1 week\" default value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA less confusing setting would be just put \"7-Days\" on each Content Role - but this is just to show that is has a lot of flexibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        NOTE\n    \n\n    \n\nIf you are using a content role in multiple schedules, the content role will be turned on according to the earlier schedule, therefore could cause conflicts with the other schedules.",

Each content role will get turned on according to the \u201cDefault Time Interval\u201d (Example: 1 week). The time interval uses the user's \"starting date\" as base for schedule. For example: If second role is set to 1 week, then the second role would be turned on 1 week after the user's starting date. Third role would be 1 week + 1 week after start date, etc.      You can also override the default time interval for each role. For example, if the 2nd role is set to 5 days, then it would get turned on 1 week (because the 1st Content Role has no value in the \"Time Interval\" it will use the default value of \"1-week\") + 5 days (set for 2nd role) from the user's \"Start Date\" - then the 3rd Content Role will turn on 1 week after the 2nd, as it has no value set, and will use the \"1 week\" default value.

The premise is that we can place a \u201cWatchdog\u201d on a certain activity, or report trigger, and they will \u201cbark\u201d at you upon the event happening, or at the frequency you set for each Watchdog.\n\n\nWatchdogs can be renamed to something of your preference, for example, the \u201cExpectation Report\u201d could be renamed the \u201cACME Training Goals Report.\u201d\n\n\nA Watchdog \u201creport/event\u201d can be turned on at the System level, which will enable it for all of the Locations within that System. When Watchdogs are enabled for a System, each location will have a \u201cWatchdog\u201d button in the Quick Links. (Note: Quick Links are available for the Access Levels of Manager and above).\n\n\nEach Watchdog \u201creport/event\u201d has certain settings that can be configured by location and each will have different characteristics and configurations, depending on what it is monitoring.\n\n\nWhen you click \u201cWatchdogs\u201d from the Quick Links, each report/event will have its own separate tab, as well as \u201cView Report\u201d and \u201cSettings\u201d tabs.\n\n\nThe View Report tab will show you the actual report/event, and tell you some information about it.\nThe Settings tab will let you configure it to your liking.\n\n\nTraining Expectations Watchdog\n\n\nThe Expectation Report is a Watchdog that allows you to determine an \u201cexpectation\u201d of training chapters that users at a location need to do, within a pre-determined period of time.\n\n\nYou can select \"Standard Training\" or \"Incentive Based Training\" for this report.\n\n\nStandard Training\n\n\nFor Standard Training, you first choose between 1 to 100 chapters and then set an expected time for the user to complete those chapters. On the Main Menu, we provide a visualization of their progress, so each time they visit the main menu they can quickly see how many chapters they've completed toward their daily, weekly, or monthly goal. \n\n\nIncentive Based Training\n\n\nFor Incentive Based Training, we recommend using this feature to set a commission for the assigned number of expected chapters completed. The flexibility with the Incentive based option allows you to set a base and maximum commission goal.\n\n\nFor example: Users can increase their potential earnings by completing assigned training during a selected time period. Your base and max percentages can be any number, but for an example scenario: Say that employees start with a base commission of 10% and by training, they may earn up to the maximum set goal of 20% during the specified time period. \n\n\nIf it is an option, you may also allow users to earn any percentage in between the base and the max, if you make it a requirement that they do not have to complete ALL of the expected chapters by the end of the time period. \n\n\nThis can be a great way to see how motivated your users are.\n\n\nDisplay on Main Menu?\n\n\nThis is a new feature so we have made this optional, but we encourage you to use it. By activating this, you can encourage users to achieve their goals by displaying their progress on the main menu. The Progress Widget will replace the \"My Sign Ins\" Widget on the Main Menu, and it is updated in real time.\n\n\nCreate a Training Expectation - Standard Expectation\n\n\nWe'll now walk through how to configure this for the first time. The first question is:\n\n\n\n\nAt what interval do you want to set the expectations and receive this report?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can set this expectation to run Daily (at a certain time), Weekly (at a certain time, on a certain day) or Monthly (at a certain time, and on either the 1st, 15th, or last day of the calendar month). You also will select a number of training chapters that are expected to be done within that desired time period.\n\n\nYou may skip to the next section if you are only using a \"Standard\" expectation.\n\n\nIncentive Based\n\n\nAfter setting the interval (above) - now we have two additional questions that were not included under the Standard setting - they are:\n\n\n- Do the users need to complete ALL expected chapters in order to receive the incentive?\n\n\nIf set to Yes, the percentage on the report and the main menu widget will remain at the base percent until the user reaches the expectation goal.\n\n\nIf set to No, the percentage will show a progressive increase from the base to the maximum until the user reaches the expectation goal.\n\n\n- How is this training incentive measured?\n\n\nFor this next question, this will be how we are going to measure their commission. Set the base (or minimum) percentage to start the user out on, and then set a maximum that the user can earn by completing the expected training. (Note: this supports up to 2 decimal points)\n\n\nWho should receive this report?\n\n\nEach location can designate as many different people as they want to receive the reports, as well as the option to receive only the information on the team they've selected. This Watchdog can send you an email, which will be the full report pushed out to your email. Or it can also send you a SMS Text Message that will consist of the summary of the report. (Note: You do not have to be a user at this location to receive the report.)\n\n\nTraining Incentive Report - Use Cases\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nSay you would like to encourage your users to do their training by offering them up to a 5% bonus each month.\n\n\nYou can use the Training Incentive Tool to achieve that by configuring it the following way:\n\n\nSet the expectation to Monthly and choose 20 chapters. Next, set the base % to 0, and the Maximum to 5. My users must complete all 20 chapters in order to receive the bonus, so for question 2 I will set this to 'yes'. You and your users will be able to track their progress as the month goes by, but the percentage will never show the full 5% UNTIL all 20 chapters have been completed.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nLet's say you earn a 10% commission on every sale that you make, a sum which is paid out monthly. Now your boss says that you need to train more! From now on, you will only earn a 5% commission unless you login to LightSpeed and complete your training each month. I can do as little or as much training as I want, but I'll be paid based on the amount I complete.\n\n\nWe can set that up this way: Set the interval to Monthly, at 5 pm, on the last day of the month, and 40 chapters.\n\n\nDo users need to Complete All Training? We will set that to \"No\".\n\n\nAnd how is this incentive measurered? Well I will already receive a 5% if I do absolutely nothing, so I will set that as the Base. But since by completing the chapters I can earn up to a maximum of 10%, I'll set the maximum to 10.\n\n\nNow the Incentive is complete, I can monitor the progress of my location at any time by visiting the Watchdog, or even emailing it to myself by entering in a custom date range on the main report screen.\n\n\nThat's it for the Training Expectations Watchdog, now we'll move on to the Progress Report.\n\n\nThe Progress Report Watchdog\n\n\nThis report is pretty straight foward: This is a location report that shows usage data, so you can see how much or how little the users at your location are doing.\n\n\nNOTE: If you would like to hide a user on this report, set the user to \u201cTraining Center Reports = Hide\u201d on their User Profile.\n\n\nThe User Tracker Watchdog\n\n\nThe User Tracker is a fairly straight forward Watchdog report that allows you to track Created Users and De-Activated Users.\n\n\nCertification Watchdog\n\n\nThe Certification Watchdog report allows you to receive a snapshot of user progress through any certification you currently have setup in your system. Choose as many or as little Certifications as you like. Every 5 Certifications you select will be sent in 1 email. So if you have 12 total Certifications, you would receive 3 total emails: 5 in the first, 5 in the second, and 2 in the third.",

            "text": "Here are some basic volcabulary terms to familiarize yourself with:\n\n\nSystem\n\nThis is the fully functional \u201cSystem\u201d that is the granddaddy object that holds all of your Private Labeled Themes, and Locations and users as well as the key to your destiny. A \u201cSystem\u201d is what we configure A to Z for a client of LightSpeed VT.\n\n\nPrivate Labeled Theme\n\nWhen a client of ours takes on a large customer that wants their system \u201cPrivate Labeled,\u201d this is how we will accommodate that. It has a series of branding abilities and settings that give you the flexibility to \u201cPrivate Label\u201d your System. (Note - every System has art least one \u201cTheme\u201d which is your default theme).\n\n\nLocation\n\nThis is the organizational \u201cunit\u201d that holds end users.\n\n\nContent Container\n\nThis is where all of the Courseware Content is held. All of your Courses are here, and these can be used, and re-used across the entire System; which means, in any/all Private Label Themes and Locations.\n\n\nVideo Library\n\nThis is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to upload and encode videos content that will be used in the Courseware Management toolset.\n\n\nCourseware Management\n\nThis is located within the Super User Dashboard, and is where the Top Admins may go to Add/Edit courseware.\n\n\nContent Role\n\nThis is how you organize your Courses to be privileged to Users. A Content Role is simply made up of a list of Courses, and when a user is set to a Content Role, they may be able to have access to the Courses within it (assumingly said Courses are \u201cActive\u2019 at their Location).\n\n\nPremium Content Role\n\nThis is simply a Content Role that is set to \u201cPremium\u201d and thus only available to specified \u201cSuper Users\u201d or \u201cTop Admins.\u201d These are used for content that is reserved for premium needs and may be a premium purchase, therefore you do not want Location Managers turning this on for users on their own (as they need to purchase it). These \u201cPremium Content Roles\u201d can be set per-Location for further flexibility.\n\n\nSuper User Dashboard\n\nThis feature allows access to all of the multi-location administration and reporting tools.\n\n\nMain Menu\n\nThis is the first screen users are presented with upon successful sign in. This is springboard or \u201cMain Menu\u201d that has access to all of the features and areas of the System that users need, via the Carousel Panels, the System Modules and the Quicklinks, to name a few.\n\n\nMain Menu Message (Video)\n\nThis Main Menu Message is automatically displayed within the Main Menu upon an end-user\u2019s first sign-in experience. This is typically used to introduce them to the VT System experience. Additionally, new Main Menu Messages can be inserted here for future communication needs, in which all users will see upon next signin. All users can replay the current Main Menu Message at any time.\n\n\nMain Menu Carousel Panels \n Carousel Panel Previews\n\nThese are the primary navigation panels, providing access and explanation to function that all users regularly use. On each carousel panel, there is an option for an approximate 30-second message that all users can click on and see. Use our default host or insert your own talent/host via custom videos.\n\n\nMain Menu Bulletin Board\n\nCustomizable text heading and greeting appearing at the top of the Main menu interface (administrable by location via location administrator \n Super Users).\n\n\nLeft and Right Side Banner Graphics\n\nDisplays custom, location-specific artwork and messages on the Main Menu.\n\n\nMy LightPad\n\nUser-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nSearch\n\nAn open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword. We can also add a drop-down contextual menu to force desired search words/phrases. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nEnd User Click Agreement\n\nLightSpeed VT offers the ability for you to have your end users go through a \u201cClick Agreement\u201d process upon first signin. The Click Agreement is a \u201cLocation\u201d specific setting and is presented to the user upon first sign in and they must click \u201cI AGREE\u201d before it will allow them to proceed. This is a text-based agreement and needs to be provided to LSVT to be implemented at the desired locations (or all locations).\n\n\nAPB \u2013 All Points Bulletin\n\nA \u201csplash screen\u201d that users see to put some communication or messaging on. This can be; video based, image and/or text based. This prompt can be inserted either as soon as a user signs in, or as soon as they click \u201cTraining Center.\u201d This is an optional screen and can be designated per location. There is also a toggle to indicate whether users can \u201cclick to now show this message again.\u201d This feature is commonly used to announce actionable messages, as you can link to any other feature or screen to do a desired activity.\n\n\nMy Report Card\n\nA multi-level report for each user to see their own progress within the training content available to them. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score.\n\n\nMy Usage Report\n\nThis is a usage report that provides a visual dashboard of activity, or lack thereof. It includes sign in activity and content usage and can be filtered in many ways, including by date range. (NOTE: The name of this report may be changed as desired.)\n\n\nMy Profile\n\nA screen where each user can edit their own profile (access to this can be toggled off per user as desired.)\n\n\nMy Favorites\n\nQuick access to a list of training Chapters that each user may have indicated as their favorites. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration. \u201cFavorites \n Ratings\u201d are tied together as one feature.)\n\n\nFile Vault\n\nA repository to place downloadable resources for each location. Location administrators and managers also have access to add resources to this File Vault for their location as desired. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nMy Certifications\n\nThis is where users can see any \u201cCertification\u201d that are available to them. There may be more than one certification available to them at a time. A Certification can be assigned to an Access Level, and is made up of a set of courses. Once all of the courses are complete within a Certification, a printable certificate with the private label logo and colors is available for the user. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nMy Billing Profile\n\nIf the Chargify subscription shopping cart is tied to a location, this is the button a user will click to alter their billing details, such as; update credit card information, upgrade/downgrade subscription, and cancel subscription. (NOTE: They \u201cMy Billing Profile\u201d feature is disabled in the System configuration if Chargify is not utilized.)\n\n\nCalendar\n\nThis is a \u201cTo-Do\u201d Calendar for end users to use. This first version of the Calendar is location centric, and unique per user. This means that the assignments and the viewing of the Calendar is at the \u201cLocation\u201d level, not the Super User, or Multi-Location level in this version. Events can be added/updated a few different ways. Users can create events for anything they would like, such as: appointments, reminders, training task, etc. Admins/Managers can assign events to one or more users and can view calendars of Users to see if the events have been completed.\n\n\nMy Notes\n\nNotes are enabled on each chapter in the Training Center, which adds a \u201cMy Notes\u201d tab on every video. This allows the users to click this tab, and it will expand a little note pad where they can take notes on each chapter as they follow along with the video. These notes can be reviewed at anytime by clicking \u201cMy Notes\u201d from the System Modules on the Main Menu and all of the chapters that notes were taken on, will output here. These notes can be searched, printed and exported to a PDF as desired.\n\n\nAdmin Quick Links Menu\n\nThis menu is visible only to Location Managers, Administrators and Super Users (it is hidden to standard users) and contains all of the buttons to access the features and reports that are needed to oversee and administrate the System.\n\n\nReport Cards\n\nA multi-level report for managers to select desired users and view their progress within the training content available to each user at that location. Each Category, Course and Chapter may be clicked to provide a series of drilled down screens of individual details of each interaction and score. Results can all be exports to serve additional needs.\n\n\nUsage Report\n\nThis report is for managers to select desired users and a date range and view their history of usage including sign ins, content usage and pass/fail attempts. This is plotted against a date range with graphs to provide a visual of their activity or lack thereof. This report is a multi-level report allowing the manager/admin to click on the data and get a drilled down view of what makes up each of the summary numbers.\n\n\nContent Report\n\nThis is a multi-level report allowing a manager/admin to select a date range, and then any desired Category, Course and Chapters and view total usage on each piece of content, and also drill down to see the \u201cattempted/pass/fail\u201d data on each, and additionally click each of those numbers to reveal what users and dates comprise those summaries.\n\n\nManage Users\n\nThis allows for the administration of all of the users at this location. It provides menus to create/edit users, as well as search for users based on some different filters and sorting criteria, as well as export these search results for additional needs.\n\n\nAuto Email Upon User Creation\n\nThis feature can email a notification to the user, that their username has been created. This is handy so that as Admins/Managers create users, those users are automatically notified that their account has been created.\n\n\nEnrollment\n\nThis allows Admins/Managers (who have the privilege to \u201cCreate Users\u201d) to easily enroll users at their location. This feature allows the Admin/Manager to define what type of user they want to enroll, then there are two options on how to notify users: 1) the Admin/Manager can enter or upload a list of email addresses and the System will notify these users via email to complete their enrollment, or 2) the System will generate a unique URL/link that can be used in other ways, such as: email campaigns, printed on collateral, etc.\n\n\nLocation Settings\n\nAdministration menu for location information. Settings include: Address Information, the Main Menu Bulletin Board, and Location Graphic Tiles/Side Banner.\n\n\nWatch Dogs\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where, in theory, a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be configured per location as desired.\n\n\nAccess Levels\n\nThis is what defines a user\u2019s privileges, or \u201caccess/no access\u201d to administrative features. Example: Manager vs. Standard User (this is a distinct set of levels that are defined later in this document).\n\n\nContent Roles\n\nThis designation defines what content is available to each user. A user can be a member of multiple \u201cContent Roles\u201d allowing for infinite flexibility for designating content to users.\n\n\nTeam\n\nThis allows for the administration of teams at each location. A team can be set up to organize users for reporting reasons. Once a team is created, it will appear on the user\u2019s profile and each user can be assigned to a team. On the reports, there is then a filter for viewing by teams. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nCategories\n\nCourses are organized into Categories in the Training Center Menu. Categories are controlled from the top level of the application and may be toggled on per location. If a Category is toggled off for a specific location, none of the users will be able to see any of the Courses that are inside that Category. Once a user clicks on a Category, a list of Courses is presented.\n\n\nCourses\n\nA Course is made up of a series of Chapters, a Course description (in text), a Course thumbnail (picture or image representing the Course) and a Course Preview Trailer (video). You can decide if a user can take the Chapters in any order they choose, or if they are required to take them in order.\n\n\nCourse Preview Trailer\n\nA short video (approximately 30 seconds) that gives the user a brief explanation of what the course will cover.\n\n\nChapter\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter (Chapter module) of their choice (if they are not required to take the Chapters in order). When all Chapters in a Course are complete, the Course is then marked complete. A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter module may consist of up to multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of one of the following media types: video, Flash SWF, or PDF document. A Chapter may consist of training parts and a Chapter test; training parts and no test; or no training parts and only a test. A test may be followed by an optional \u201cRecap\u201d Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test.\n\n\nPlayback Privileges\n\nFast-forward and the \u201cskip\u201d button are only available to top level location managers, administrators and Super Users by default. There is optional configuration to make additional access levels have these privileges.\n\n\nCaptions\n\nClosed Captions can be added to each Chapter, allowing users to toggle Captions on and off for their desired language. (NOTE: Content needs to be transcribed with time code and then also translated into a desired language.)\n\n\nFavorites and Ratings\n\nThe ability for a user to mark this Chapter as a Favorite, and also rate it on a scale of 1 to 5. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled in the System configuration.)\n\n\nSocialize\n\nThis feature provides the ability for your users to post to social networks, specifically Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin, after they complete interactive training Chapters.",
