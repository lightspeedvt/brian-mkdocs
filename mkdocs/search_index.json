            "text": "Courseware Management\n\n\nThis article is a \u201cquick\u201d overview on how the whole \u201cCourseware Management\u201d area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.\n\n\nWhen your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users underneath it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.\n\n\n*NOTE - \u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Upload your videos into the Video Library\n\nThe Video Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Video Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.\n\n\nStep 2. Assemble your videos into Courses\n\nOnce you have one or more videos in the Video Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Video Library first). These videos will also be added to the Video Library for you automatically.\n\n\nStep 3. Add your courses to Content Roles\n\nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d \u2026 all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.\n\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have these Content Roles:\n\nSales Strategies - (this has courses on sales training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)\n\nCompliance - (this has courses on mandatory compliance training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)\n\nFront Desk Training - (this has courses on how to run the front desk) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)\n\n\nStep 4. Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location\n\nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.\n\n\nStep 5. Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired\n\nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are \u201cActive\u201d at their Location.\n\n\nIn the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and I show two of the Courses as being \u201cInactive\u201d and they are grayed out. You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d (for some reason California seems to have way more laws about Compliance than anywhere else).\n\n\nYou can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.\n\n\nThis flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        NOTE\n    \n\n    \n\nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find deeper details on each area of it in other articles.\n\n\n\n\nThe Details: Categories\n\n\nA category is made up of one or more courses, a text description, an image thumbnail (picture or image representing the content) and if applicable, a rollover image thumbnail (an additional image that will appear when a user hovers over the tile with their mouse).\n\n\n Create or Edit a Category - Basic Info\n\n\nAfter you have selected your content container, you can select \nCategory List\n, where you can either \nSearch\n for an existing category, or \nCreate a new category\n.\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this category should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not be on display for anyone until you complete the very last step of this process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1, Required Field\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the category will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category. If two or more categories are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory Type\n - \nStandard or List of Links\n\n\nA category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\". A \"List of Links\" means you can use a category to point to additional categories, OR you can use the category to link out to another website, link to a file to download, etc. \"Standard\" categories, when clicked, will simply load the courses that are assigned to that category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n - \nRequired Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the category here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nHere you can enter the image path to the category image, or choose to upload one from your local device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail Roll Over (Optional)\n - \nThis can be left blank\n\n\nHere you can enter the path to the category rollover image, or choose to upload one from your local device. This is similar to the Thumbnail above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen to Thumbnail\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThe \"Yes\" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to \"No\", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (Custom CSS, GIF, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sheen = Yes\n\n\nAdd Sheen = No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nFile Size best practices: Every time one of your users load the Training Center they will be downloading all of the visible artwork on the screen. This means you should keep in mind file size when uploading image thumbnails. Currently LightSpeed VT does not compress any files when you upload them. If you add a 50mb image to one of your Category tiles, the user is going to have to download that every time.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCategory - Additional Information\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the description of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Description\n - \nCan be left blank\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is an Internal view for you only. This can be used to add additional important details about the course, or even to log recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nA Course is made up of one or more Chapters, a text description, an image tile (picture or image representing the content) and a Course Preview Trailer (video).\n\n\nAfter you have selected your content container, you will be on the \nCourse List\n screen, where you can either \nSearch\n for an existing course, or \nCreate a new course\n.\n\n\n Create or Edit a Course - Basic Info\n\n\n\n\nActive Yes/No\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nSelect whether this course should be active or not. (Note: It is safe to always select \"Yes\" here - this content will not be on display for anyone until you complete the very last step of this process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this course will display in the training center. The \nlower\n the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the course will be listed in the system. Rank 1 = the very first course. Rank 999 = the very last course. If two or more courses are set to the same Rank, then the system will sort them alphabetically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\nA \"Linked Course (Banner)\" indicates that this course will be used to link to another course, rather than linking to a set of chapters as a Standard course would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n - \nDefault: Required Field\n\n\nEnter the name of the course here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n - \nDefault: Required Field\n\n\nSelect which category this course should go in. (Note: Currently a course can only be in 1 category at a time.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nEnter the path to the course image. This will be the web URL to where the image is hosted on your server. Or, you can click on \"Choose File\" to upload a thumbnail from your local device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview Video\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the path to the course video preview (If you do not have a course preview video, just leave this blank.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for the entire course. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Chapter level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n9.. \nCourse Description\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the description of the course. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Internal Description\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a course belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nEnter the name of the author of this material (Usually the client's name - but if it's a collaboration, enter the name of the System, ex. Patricia Fripp as an individual, or NCM OnDemand as a collaboration, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nThis field is for the duration, in minutes, of the course. (This feature is currently not in use.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse - Display Settings\n\n\n\n\nHide this Course from Reports\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will show/hide the course in reporting sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide this Course from Search\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will toggle the course from being searchable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Chapters in Order\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this toggle to \"Yes\" will force the user to complete the chapters in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse - Keywords\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nAdd any keywords associated with this course. Type in your desired Keyword and then hit enter. Enter as many keywords as you desire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse - Extended Info\n\n\n\n\nExtended Info\n - \nThis can be left blank.\n\n\nThis is for advanced Content Configuration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse - Content Role Assignments\n\n\nWhen you have entered all of your information, click \n\"Save\"\n, and move on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nChapters\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.\n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc..\n\n\n\n\nA Chapter may consist of:\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from an existing \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous section that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top.\n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Basic Info\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\nCreate your chapter by filling out these fields:\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nIf this is a standard chapter, you must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the \nhigher\n the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Name\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Type:\n\n\nStandard (Video and Test)\n\n\nTest Only\n\n\nVideo Only (with Auto Advance)\n\n\nVideo Only (with Summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at these chapter types.\n\n\n1. Standard (Video and Test)\n\n\nIn a Standard chapter type, the chapter must have at least 1 video part and at least 1 test question.\n\n\nAfter selecting 'Standard', you will need to click on 'Add Chapter Part' and either upload a new video to your \nVideo Library\n, or copy and paste the path of an existing video in your \nVideo Library\n into the chapter part field. \n\n\nSummary Info\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Settings\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\nNote: You will not be able to activate this chapter until this number matches the number of test questions added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n - \nDefault: 100\n\n\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Type\n - \nDefault: Standard\n\n\n\n\nYour options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n - \nDefault: 1\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n. After the course is created there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nFor a default video for a \"LaFR\" we use: \nhttp://videos.lightspeedvt.com/video_files/coming_soon.mp4\n - this is a path to a placeholder \"Coming Soon\" video. This is used so we can show our clients a completed system without actually having any of their content ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path. \nLeave Blank for now.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself.

For this exercise, we'll enter a placeholder question. Enter this text into the Question field: \nDid you understand everything in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Active\n - \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis is a simple toggle - this will default to yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Rank\n\n\nThis field will increase in rank for each test question you add. It is only used when the chapter toggle \n\"Pull Questions in Order by Rank\"\n is set to \n\"Yes\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A) \n B)\n\n\nThis field is for the first possible test question answer.

If this is unchecked, after a user answers a test question, the \n\"Correct\"\n and \n\"Incorrect\"\n dialogue pop-ups will not be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Action\n - \nDefault: None\n\n\nThis drop-down box is where you can setup an answer response. You can either select a video response or a text response. If a video response is selected (FLV), then you will enter a path to that video in the \nResponse Info\n field. If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the \nResponse Info\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Info\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nThis field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n - \nLeave blank for now.\n\n\nYou can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Answer\n\n\nHere you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold \nCtrl/Command\n you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Timer\n - \nDefault: 60\n\n\nHere you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the fields are complete, hit \n\"Save\"\n and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.\n\n\nNext Steps - Activation\n\n\nAnd that is it. You should have now successfully created a Category, Course, Chapter and Test Question.\n\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\n\nHere are some basic volcabulary terms to familiarize yourself with:\n\n\nTraining Center:\n This is where users navigate \u2013 topically \u2013 through the available content, with Courses being the building blocks of the content that users have available to them to complete.\n\n\nThere are different types of Courses that the Training Center can display such as: VT Courseware, which is the LSVT format that inherently comes with your VT System; SCORM, which is a standardized format which outside authoring tools can be utilized to build courses; or \u201ccustom\u201d where you may engage in a custom build of a Course type to accommodate a specific need.\n\n\nCategory Selection Menu\n: This is the top level of the navigation hierarchy and Course grouping.\n\n\nCourse Selection Menu\n: This is the second level of training center navigation. The Course is the building block that is turned on in location for Content Roles that users are assigned to. A category will automatically appear for a user if there is a Course within that Category that the user has privileges to.\n\n\nCourse Summary Screen (Chapter Menu)\n:  This is the screen a user sees when they select a Course. This menu is slightly different if it is VT Courseware vs. SCORM courseware.",

            "text": "This article is a \u201cquick\u201d overview on how the whole \u201cCourseware Management\u201d area works. The other subsequent articles will give you deeper descriptions and literal \u201cstep-by-step\u201d walkthroughs of every feature and function, but if you read and understand this overview first, you\u2019ll be able to follow along much more clearly.  When your VT Account is created, it comes along with a Content Container and this is where all of your content is \u201ccontained\u201d and it is what feeds all of the Systems, Private Labeled Themes, Locations and Users underneath it. This diagram below walks you through the 5 basic steps of getting content created from scratch - to ultimately available for your end users to see.  *NOTE - \u201cCourses\u201d are the ON/OFF building block across the whole application. This will become clearer as soon as you understand how they interact with \u201cContent Roles\u201d - \u201cLocations\u201d and \u201cUsers.\u201d   Step 1. Upload your videos into the Video Library \nThe Video Library will let you upload any format of \u201csource\u201d video into it, and it will do all of the encoding for you to all of the different formats that we need. When a video is in the Video Library, you can reuse that video asset anywhere in the application that you want to.  Step 2. Assemble your videos into Courses \nOnce you have one or more videos in the Video Library, you can create/edit Courses and Chapters and add the videos to them as needed. As you add Chapters, you will also see that you can upload videos right \u201cin-line\u201d while you are editing Chapters as well (vs. having to go add them to the Video Library first). These videos will also be added to the Video Library for you automatically.  Step 3. Add your courses to Content Roles \nSo far we have talked about \u201cVideos\u201d and \u201cCourses\u201d ... and now on to \u201cContent Roles\u201d \u2026 all of these things are part of your \u201cContent Container\u201d as illustrated in the top large gray box that represents your entire \u201cContent Container.\u201d Content Roles allow you to organize your Courses as you wish. These Content Roles are represented by the yellow rectangles in the diagram above, and they have \u201cCourses\u201d within them. You can have \u201c1\u201d Course in a Content Role, or \u201c1,000,000,000.\u201d You can also put the same Course into many different Content Roles if needed.  For example, let\u2019s say you have these Content Roles: \nSales Strategies - (this has courses on sales training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course) \nCompliance - (this has courses on mandatory compliance training) AND (the New Hire Orientation course) \nFront Desk Training - (this has courses on how to run the front desk) AND (the New Hire Orientation course)  Step 4. Make Courses \u201cActive\u201d at each desired Location \nAll of the Courses that are Active in your Content Container may be turned ON or OFF at each/any Location. Once a Course is Active at a Location, it may very well be inside a Content Role that a User has, and then a User at a Location will see that Course.  Step 5. Each User can be set to as many Content Roles as desired \nThe list of available Content Roles for each user, is the list that is established from your Content Container. Once a User is set to a Content Role, they will see the list of Courses that are Active in that Content Role - as long as each of those Courses are \u201cActive\u201d at their Location.  In the diagram above, there is a dotted line that represents the \u201cLocation stuff.\u201d For each Location there is a Course List, and I show two of the Courses as being \u201cInactive\u201d and they are grayed out. You will then see in the Content Roles for the User (the yellow rectangles) that there are the two grayed out Courses - one in each Content Role. Here is an example where that flexibility can be really helpful:  Let\u2019s say you have a Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d and you have two different courses in it, one is \u201cCompliance Laws\u201d and a separate, but similar course is \u201cCompliance Laws for California\u201d (for some reason California seems to have way more laws about Compliance than anywhere else).  You can put both versions of your Course in the Content Role called \u201cCompliance\u201d - and then when Managers create users, they will simply assign them the Content Role of \u201cCompliance.\u201d However, you can Activate the \u201cCalifornia\u201d Compliance Course only at the Locations in California, and the regular Compliance Course everywhere else.  This flexibility may be more than what you need, but it is all there to accommodate any type of content activation needs you may have.  \n     \n        NOTE\n     \n     \nThere is a way to make some Content Roles \u201cPremium\u201d so that they are not visible at the Location level to be set to users, but you as the Top Admin can see them. This gives you even more flexibility for when you want to start offering premium content to Locations as an up-sell item that can be purchased. We will go into this more later in the \u201cin-depth\u201d area of these Help Docs.\n       So, that is the \u201cquick\u201d overview of how Courseware Management works. You can find deeper details on each area of it in other articles.",

Category Type  -  Standard or List of Links  A category can be \"Standard\" or it can be a \"List of Links\".

If Text is selected, then you will enter your text answer response in the  Response Info  field.    Response Info  -  Leave blank for now.  This field will be filled out only if the Response Action field is active.    Points  -  Leave blank for now.  You can assign a point value to each different answer. This feature was designed to eventually lead to a \"Leaderboard\" where users can see how they rank against other users. Currently this feature is disabled, but the field was left here for when the development team eventually circles back to it.    Correct Answer  Here you can select \"Any / All Correct\", or any individual answer. If you hold  Ctrl/Command  you can select more than one answer. For this exercise select answer \"A\".    Question Timer  -  Default: 60  Here you can set, in miliseconds, how long the question timer should be. We default to 60 seconds.     Once all of the fields are complete, hit  \"Save\"  and then click on the chapter name at the top of the screen to return to the chapter menu. From there you can now activate the chapter.",

This new Mobile App is intended to be a \ncompanion\n to the web application, not instead of, or to use one or the other.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nClients and End Users want a \"Mobile\" experience! We can achieve the best of both worlds by making our Web App extremely mobile-friendly, and then leveraging the Mobile App (or Companion App) for functions that a Web App cannot perform. \n\n\nThe LSVT application is very feature rich and applies so many flexible business rules to both content and privileges that it would be extremely complex and very time intensive to build even a parallel Mobile App and keep it updated as frequently as the Web App gets updated. \n\n\nFurthermore, an End User sitting down and taking full interactive training and testing on a Mobile App on a small PHONE is not the use case we are looking to solve. An end user will want a Mobile App to access short, daily training, or download content to take \"on the go\" for situations where there might not be a stable Internet connection. Below are the two approaches we can do, simultaneously, and have the \u201cbest of both worlds.\u201d\n\n\nAccess - The  VT2GO app is a free download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Once downloaded and launched, users will sign in with their Web App login credentials. In other words, only ACTIVE (subscribed via the Web App) usernames will be able to successfully sign in from the Mobile App and utilize its unique features. The mobile app has been built to accommodate users with multiple profiles (and user names) at once, just as you might access two Twitter accounts from the same device - you would simply select which profile you want to utilize when launched. \n\n\nContent - There will be different/alternate content available for the Mobile App vs. the Web App, with the understanding that: \u201cJust because it is available on the Web App, doesn't mean it will automatically be available on the Mobile App.\u201d Primarily, this is because not every piece of content is Mobile App-friendly. Unlike the Web App, the Mobile App isn't capable of serving up extensive interactivity, certain testing formats, etc.\n\n\nConfiguration Steps\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill all the existing content just \"work?\" - No, unfortunately, there is a step to do in order to format videos for this native mobile solution. The content department will have to address each existing client and determine what is desired to be available on the VT2GO App.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill audio work? Yes, MP3 and MP4 files will work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we prevent end users for subscribing for 1 day and downloading it all for offline use? For each client group, there is a parameter where we can set the number of videos/audios that are available for offline use. For example, if that parameter is set to \"3\", and the user has already downloaded three videos for offline viewing, they will need to delete one video, before they can download a new one. This places limits on how many downloads they are allowed to have at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the tests work? Not yet. Testing and quiz questions are planned for a future phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about long files, such as 60 minute audio files? Content intended for the mobile app may be built differently than content for the web app. With this in mind, we can make a \"Course\" behave differently. For example, on the web application a 60 minute file may be cut into 5 minute segments, whereas on the native mobile app, this 60 minute segment may be played or downloaded as one continuous file, so the user can listen to it offline in the car or on an airplane.",

Within the System, these Access Levels can be renamed, turned on/off, and select privileges toggled on/off to best suit your needs. \n\n\nThe Access Levels have ID#\u2019s 2 through 12 so that when you rename them, you can still see the ID# in some areas so you know which is which (Access Level #1 is reserved for internal LSVT use).\n\n\nThe Access Levels are split into four sets:\n\n\nSuper Users:    ID# 2 and 3\n\n\nThe Super User has access to the Super User Dashboard, and in short, that means they can have access to more than one Location. Your internal team of \u201cTop Admins\u201d will always be the highest level, which is ID# 2.\n\n\nYou will often rename Access Level #3 to a \u201cMulti Location Manager\u201d - so that these users can oversee and run reports on multiple Locations.\n\n\nManagers:   ID# 4, 5 and 6\n\n\nThe \u201cManager\u201d has access to oversee Users that are at their Access Level and below. They can create users (if toggled the ability to do so) and they can run reports. The users they can create and reports that they can run are limited to their own Location.\n\n\nUsers:  ID# 7, 8 and 9\n\n\nThis Access Level is for standard users. There is often only the need to use one of these \u201cUser\u201d Access Levels and turn the others off. They all have the same exact privileges (or lack thereof) in that they can only see their own reports, and not other users. This level does have access to the LightPad Message Center and can send messages to other users at their Location.\n\n\nHowever one reason why you may want to use all three of these Access Levels is if you have the need to \u201cAuto-Populate\u201d content to a user, based on their Access Level. In this case,  you may need more than one \u201cUser\u201d Access Level to designate what you need.\n\n\nTo learn more about how to use the \u201cAuto Populate\u201d Content Feature, \nfollow me...\n\n\nLimited Users:  ID# 10, 11 and 12\n\n\nThis Access Level is almost exactly the same as the  \u201cUser\u201d set, with the exception that in the LightPad Message Center, this Access Level can only send a message to \u201cSupport\u201d and not to other other users at their Location.\n\n\nHow to Configure Access Levels\n\n\nIn the Super User Dashboard, go to the \u201c400 - Application Administration\u201d area, and look in the \u201c401 - System Management\u201d section for the button called \u201cManage Access Levels.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you have access to more than one System, you will first select the System you want to administrate the Access Levels for, and click \u201cGet Access Levels.\u201d From here you will see the list of Access Levels, and you can rename them for you needs and toggle a few privileges for each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe privilege toggle switches next to each one are:\n\n\nVisible: Simply set to \u201cNo\u201d if you do not want to use certain Access Levels.\n\n\nSkip Video: If set to \u201cYes\u201d then these users will be able to Fast Forward the videos, as well as see a \u201cSkip\u201d button on the right side of the video player.\n\n\nShow Answers: If set to \u201cYes\u201d then these users will see the correct answers highlighted in green on the standard multiple choice test questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        NOTE\n    \n\n    \n\nAccess Level 13 is an extra Access Level reserved for \u201cAnonymous Users\u201d - which are set up for ESPs and other advanced content features. These Advanced content features will have Super User Admin tools in the near future.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Level Privileges\n\n\nBelow is a grid of the specific privileges that each Access Level has built in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Access\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n 6 \n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper User Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend LightPad Messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip Training Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links Menu\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n 6 \n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Report Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Report Card Drill Down Info / Test Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Usage Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertification Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage (Create \n Edit) Teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View Teams and Teams' Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n 6 \n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Location Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Main Menu Left/Right Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Main Menu Bulletin Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n = If the associated \u201cYes/No\u201d privilege toggle is set in the \u201cManage Access Levels\u201d - it will decide this privilege.\n\n\n = This ability is able to be overridden on each user's profile, there is a Yes/No toggle for \u201cAbility to Manage Users\u201d that can be set per individual.

The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Job Positions\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position.

On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Use New Category Layout\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nChanging this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Layout Column Count\n \n\n\nIf the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Settings\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google Translation\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nGoogle Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Smartling Translation\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System.

This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendgrid Subuser\n\n\nThis feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function. \n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages. These reports can be activated under System Settings, and configured per location as desired.\n\n\n\n\nWatchdog Enabled Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the Watchdog reporting feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Expectations Friendly Name\n \n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress Report Friendly Name\n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Tracker Friendly Name\n\n\nHere you can update the name of the report to something different if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Settings\n\n\nThis is an open field for users to search for content in the Training Center by title, description and keyword.

We can do things like; when a User Completes Course A,  it unlocks Course B (and you can show a \u201clocked\u201d version of Course B before it is unlocked).

Until they are granted access to additional Locations; all of the tools or reports they utilize will simply just show data from their own Location - nothing more.\n\n\nThere are really two main \u201cUser Cases\u201d for needing to add more abilities to these Super Users, and they are:\n\n\nThe first one is; granting a \u201cMulti-Location Manager\u201d the ability to administer more than their own Location. This is for your clients that may own more than one Location, and need to administrate its users and run reports.\n\n-OR-\n\nPerhaps you have a large sales team, and you want to give certain sales reps oversight over only \u201ctheir\u201d customer Locations - this is handy for that reason too.\n\n\nThe second \u201cUser Case\u201d is for creating another \u201cTop Level\u201d admin other than yourself that has the ability to administer certain settings over the entire \u201cSystem.\u201d This may be to manage content or other \u201cTop Admin\u201d tasks that more users at your company may be doing.\n\n\nMulti-Location Manager\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first \u201cUser Case\u201d I mentioned above. This is when you have a \u201cMulti-Location Manager\u201d that you want to grant them the ability to administer more than one Location. This means that when they go to the Super User Dashboard, any of the tools or reports that they go to use, will have these additional Locations included in them. Anytime they see a Location name that is clickable, they can click that Location name and go administer that specific Location. We call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d to that Location.\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User at Access Level \u201c3\u201d (Super User C), just like you would create any user (or change their Access Level if they already exist). Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a line of info text near the top that looks like this example below.\n\n\n\n\nThis will tell how you how many Locations this user has Super User access to, it also has:\nA clickable link that says \u201cView Super User Access\u201d and if clicked, a modal window will appear with a list of Locations that this Super User has Access to.\nAnother clickable link that says \u201cEdit Super User Acess\u201d and if clicked, will take you to the Admin area where you now designate additional Locations that this user can have access to.\n\n\nYou can select which \u201cSystem\u201d you want to get a list of Location for (if there is more than one), and also specify a Location Name (or part of one) and indicate if you want results of both Active \n Inactive Location, or just one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get the results from that search, you will see a list of Locations, and a \u201ccheck box\u201d to the left of each one. By checking (or unchecking) these boxes, you can determine which Locations this Super User has access to.\n\n\nAt the bottom, you can select what \u201cupdate type\u201d you want to do;\n\nAdd Selected - this will leave whatever settings are in place, and merely \u201cAdd Selected\u201d Locations that you \u201cchecked\u201d above to it. It is harmless if you add a Location twice - don\u2019t worry about that.\n\nDelete All Existing and Add Selected - this is handy if there are 100\u2019s of Lcoations listed and you want to ensure you only give this person distinct access to whatever you just \u201cchecked\u201d so this will remove any settings that were there prior, and ONLY add the new ones you \u201cchecked.\u201d\n\nDelete Selected - this is where you want to remove certain ones only. This will take into account what is currently \u201cchecked\u201d for this user, and then delete the ones you have selected.\n\n\nClick \u201cSave Super User Access Changes\u201d once you are done making changes.\n\n\n\n\nSuper User-ing to Locations\n\n\nWhen you want to bounce around to other Locations and look in on users, run reports, etc. - we call that \u201cSuper User-ing\u201d around. So, then you are in the Super User Dashboard, anytime you see a Location name that is linked, you can click on the Location Name, and you will be \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to that Location, and dropped at the \u201cMain Menu.\u201d Now, don\u2019t get confused as it may look a lot like every time you sign in as yourself, BUT\u2026 it\u2019s not. You are seeing the view as THAT LOCATION you \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to - and you will see the Location name on the top right - check it out in the screenshot below. I have left my primary Location, and I \u201cSuper User\u2019d\u201d to a different Location called \u201cACME Blue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf there is other branding items that are different than your primary Location then you will see a lot of the branded artwork and such for that Location you Super User\u2019d to - that\u2019s normal. You can now click in to the top nav menu and access the Quick Links, and they will all be relative to that Location you are now Super User\u2019d to. Examples are:\n\nManage Users - you will now be administrating users at THAT Location only.\n\nReport Cards - you will now be viewing Report Cards on users at THAT Location only.\n\nLocation Settings - you will now be changing \u201cLocation Settings\u201d at THAT Location only.\n\nEtc.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        NOTE\n    \n\n    \n\nOne important thing to know is - if you click on the TRAINING CENTER while you are Super User-ing around, you will still always see YOUR \u201cTraining Center\u201d - NOT the Location you have Super User\u2019d to. \u2026 and the reason is\u2026 YOUR username likely has very different Content Roles than the Users at the Location you are Super User\u2019d to. Or at the very least, what user Content Roles are you expecting to be represented to see here? It is impossible to know. If you want to see what that specific TRAINING CENTER looks like, you will need to \u201cimpersonate\u201d a user and then look (learn about the impersonation feature here).\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCreating another \u201cTop Level\u201d Admin (Super User B)\n\n\nYou will likely have the need to create other top level \u201cSuper Users\u201d at your company, and you will want to grant them appropriate privileges to administer a lot the settings in the VT System. This section will briefly explain how you can create and administrate Super User B\u2019s for your organization, as you can grant them as many or as few privileges as you wish.\n\n\nFirst, you will need create a Super User B, just like you would create any user - likely at your \u201cAdmin Location.\u201d Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a new \u201ctab\u201d on the top called \u201cSuper User B Privilege\u201d and if you click on that tab, will will then see all of the privileges listed out, and a \u201cYES/NO\u201d toggle for each. They all have a \u201c?-ICON\u201d that you can hover over and get a tooltip as to what each privilege does.",

Once the user exists, you will then want to go to the Super User Dashboard, and \u201cSearch\u201d for them with the \u201c201 - Manage All Users\u201d tool. Once you select their username, you will see a line of info text near the top that looks like this example below.   This will tell how you how many Locations this user has Super User access to, it also has:\nA clickable link that says \u201cView Super User Access\u201d and if clicked, a modal window will appear with a list of Locations that this Super User has Access to.\nAnother clickable link that says \u201cEdit Super User Acess\u201d and if clicked, will take you to the Admin area where you now designate additional Locations that this user can have access to.  You can select which \u201cSystem\u201d you want to get a list of Location for (if there is more than one), and also specify a Location Name (or part of one) and indicate if you want results of both Active   Inactive Location, or just one or the other.   Once you get the results from that search, you will see a list of Locations, and a \u201ccheck box\u201d to the left of each one. By checking (or unchecking) these boxes, you can determine which Locations this Super User has access to.  At the bottom, you can select what \u201cupdate type\u201d you want to do; \nAdd Selected - this will leave whatever settings are in place, and merely \u201cAdd Selected\u201d Locations that you \u201cchecked\u201d above to it. It is harmless if you add a Location twice - don\u2019t worry about that. \nDelete All Existing and Add Selected - this is handy if there are 100\u2019s of Lcoations listed and you want to ensure you only give this person distinct access to whatever you just \u201cchecked\u201d so this will remove any settings that were there prior, and ONLY add the new ones you \u201cchecked.\u201d \nDelete Selected - this is where you want to remove certain ones only. This will take into account what is currently \u201cchecked\u201d for this user, and then delete the ones you have selected.  Click \u201cSave Super User Access Changes\u201d once you are done making changes.",

You can now click in to the top nav menu and access the Quick Links, and they will all be relative to that Location you are now Super User\u2019d to.

Or at the very least, what user Content Roles are you expecting to be represented to see here? It is impossible to know.

The field called \"Start Date\" is noted in blue in the screen shot below, is auto-populated by the \"Created Date\" however this field \"Start Date\" can be changed, for the reason of changing this user's \"Schedule\" if desired.\n\n\nThis \"Scheduler\" feature will run off of the \"Start Date\" and it will roll out content roles, based on that \"Start Date.\"\n\n\n\n\nCreating A Schedule\n\n\nTo Create a \"Schedule\" for a client, use the webservices/API admin tab \"Scheduled Courses\" and then search for the desired \"Group\" - one the desired Group is selected, you can create as many \"Schedules\" as desired.

In this example below - our \"Starting\" Content Role is called \"Schedule 1 - Start.\" (example - if you are creating a Schedule that rolls content out by \"week\" - you may want to name this \"starting role\" - \"Week 1\" - but this is flexible for you to name it as needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse whatever means you need, to ensure the desired users have access to this Content Role - it can be through the \"Auto Populate Role ID's by Access Level\" or whatever you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Web Services/Schedule Courses admin, configure a new schedule.
