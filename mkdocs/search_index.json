The team names are location specific, they are not shared across the whole system.\n\n\nUse Teams Plus\n - This setting puts the teams into a \"genealogy\" - where when the Access Level \"Mgr-C\" (Access level 6) is set to a \"Team Leader\" - then they only see users that are on their team. More information can be found \nHERE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Job Positions\n - \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will activate a new drop-down when creating or editing users to assign them a Job Position.

On new systems, this Home Icon URL is controlled in the Themer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Use New Category Layout\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nChanging this to \"Yes\" will make the category menu in the Training Center look like Topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTC Layout Column Count\n \n\n\nIf the New Layout setting (Above) is set to \"Yes\" - this setting will control how many columns to lay the Categories out in. Typically \"3\" is a good default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Share Settings\n\n\nThese are Social Share Settings...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Settings\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google Translation\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nGoogle Translate is a basic machine translation that will translate the text on all of the pages and screens of your System, it will not translate any text on graphics or video content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Smartling Translation\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information on Language and System Localization can be found...\n\n\nEnrollment (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThis feature allows Admins and Managers (who have the privilege to \"Create Users\") to easily enroll users at their location. \n\n\n\n\nEnable Enrollment Options\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nIf this toggle is set to Yes, then you must fill out the rest of the fields in order for the Enrollment email to work correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Link Text\n\n\nThis will be the button or link in the Enrollment email that the user will click on to proceed to a registration form to enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email\n\n\nThis will appear to the end user as the 'From' email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Subject\n\n\nEnter the Subject of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Top\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the top of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Body Bottom\n\n\nEnter the copy that will go on the bottom of the email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on steps to configure this can be found on our Knowledge Base \nHERE\n. \n\n\nLocation Settings\n\n\nHere you can set the \"Max Users Exceeded Error Message.\" If a Location has a Maximum Users limit, and an admin attempts to create another user, this is the error message they will see on the screen.\n\n\nThe Default text is: This location has exceeded the maximum number of active users. Please contact support.\n\n\nTypically you will want to customize this for your own system to include your own support contact information. \n\n\nLightPad Settings (Updated Per Theme)\n\n\nThe LightPad is User-to-user messaging within the VT System. This communication features can also be utilized to send SMS Text messages and emails to users as well, if configured to do so. (NOTE: This is an optional feature that can be disabled.)\n\n\nThere are two tiers to the LightPad. The first is a simple way for your end users to contact Support.\n\n\nThe second is a way for users to 'Ask the Expert' \n\n\n\n\nEnable LightPad Yes/No\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn off or on the LightPad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad From Address\n\n\nThis field is not required - if left blank it will default to \"support@lightspeedvt.com\". If the client has a support email address you will enter that here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LightPad Support Yes/No\n\n\nThis feature is nicknamed the \u201cAsk The Expert\u201d feature, where users can send a message to a pre-determined admin user that you can specify. You can use this to have a feature where users can interact with you and you can respond, within the System. Common uses for this are: \u201cAsk The Expert,\u201d \u201cNotify Support,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightPad Support Title\n\n\nThis is the Title of the custom support message. Example: Ask Tony Robbins!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Button Name\n \n\n\nThis is the name of the button users click to send a message to support. Example: Click Here for Help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Image\n \n\n\nEnter the path to the Image.

This text appears on the page where the user sends the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery Options\n\n\nThese settings control which message delivery options are available to users of the System. \n\n\nOnce these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.\n\n\nOnce toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.\n\n\nAdding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.\n\n\nOnce the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - LightPad\n \nDefault: Yes\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users via the LightPad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - SMS\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's email. (Note: In order to reply to the message, the user would have to login to the system and navigate to the LightPad.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Delivery - Email\n \nDefault: No\n\n\nThis will turn on or off the ability to send a message to other users from the lightpad to the user's cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendgrid Subuser\n\n\nThis feature in progress and not yet ready for LIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If the LightPad is enabled, at least one delivery option must be selected in order for it to function. \n\n\nWatchdogs\n\n\nThe Watch Dog feature is a series of reports where a \u201cwatch dog\u201d is placed at certain areas of the System and \u201cbarks\u201d when it sees something it is told to look for. It can push these reporting details out to you via email and/or SMS Text Messages.

Content Role and Access Level Instructions  Here you can customize the instructions that users/managers see on the front end when selecting Content Roles and Access Levels for users. Examples are:  Content Roles:  Content Roles determine what content a user sees, you can set a user to as many content roles as desired.  Access Levels:  Specify below the Access Level desired for this user - the Access Levels determine if this user is a Manager that can view reports, or just a standard Employee. A user can be set to only one Access Level at a time.         System Settings  Below are the System settings and notes about how they work and what they do, and the default setting for each.

Enable Smartling Translation   Default: No  If utilizing Smartling, then you would turn off the \"Google Translation\" option, as the two do not play nice. Also, when using Smartling, you need to select which languages you want to use for this System. Once done, there may be a few additional words to translate, depending on if any custom text was used for any of the System Modules or Quick Links.     More information on Language and System Localization can be found...

Once these options have been toggled to YES, they become available to to add to each user. This flexibility allows some users to opt for Emails, Text Messages, or LightPad messages only, based on their personal preference.  Once toggled to \"Yes\", a new tab will appear on both the location \"Manage Users\" screen and the Super User Dashboard, \"Search and Manage all Users\" screen, for the users of that System.  Adding each delivery option to a User will prompt you for more information, either adding an email address or phone number for text messages.  Once the delivery methods have been added to each user, when you create a new message in the LightPad and choose the recipients, an icon will appear next to the users name based on which delivery method is available.
