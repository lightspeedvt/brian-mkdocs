Even though in the LightSpeed heirarchy the Topics menu comes first, we're going to start with Categories. We'll explain more on this later.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 id="1-categories-overview">1. Categories Overview</h2>
<p>A category is made up of courses, a category description (in text), a category thumbnail (picture or image representing the Course) and if applicable, a rollover thumbnail.</p>
<p>To get started, navigate to Manage Content under the Super User Dashboard, <strong>400 - Application Administration</strong>, and then <strong>402 - Content Management.</strong> You will see a screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/content_mgmt.png"/></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="create-new-category">Create new Category</h3>
<p>From this screen you can either <strong>Search</strong> for an existing category, or <strong>Create a new category</strong>. To get started, click on <strong>Create a new category.</strong></p>
<p>On the <strong>Create New Category</strong> menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):</p>
<p><a href="/img/create_new_cat1.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/create_new_cat1.png"/ alt="Click to open this in a new tab"></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Name</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the name of the category here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Copied From</strong><ul>
<li>This field will be populated automatically if you created this category using the "Copy" feature. If you did not, you can leave this blank for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the description of the category. If there was none provided, enter something as a temporary placeholder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal Description</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the internal description. This is a LightSpeed viewable field only. This is used to quickly identify which client a category belongs to, or adding other important details, such as recent changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thumb Nail Image Path</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the path to the category image (we cover this later <em>here</em>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rank</strong><ul>
<li>The Rank is the order in which this category will display in the training center. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the <em>higher</em> the category will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first category. Rank 999 = the very last category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Active Yes/No</strong><ul>
<li>Select whether this category should be active or not. (It is perfectly safe to always select "Yes" here - the content will not be on display for anyone until you complete your very last step of this process. We cover that <em>here</em>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rollover Image URL</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the path to the category rollover image (we cover this later <em>here</em>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pre-composed Yes/No</strong><ul>
<li>The default setting here is usually "No". The "No" setting will automatically add rounded edges and a highlight effect to the rollover. If you set this to "Yes", it will assume you are adding the rollover and rounded corners through other means (css, flash, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pre-composed = No</th>
<th>Pre-composed = Yes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="/img/pre-composed-no.png"></td>
<td><img src="/img/pre-composed-yes.png"></td>
</tr>

<h2 id="3-chapter-overview">3. Chapter Overview</h2>
<p>Once a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.  </p>
<p>A Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc.. </p>
<p><strong>A Chapter may consist of...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Training parts and a Chapter test.</li>
<li>Training parts and no test.</li>
<li>No training parts and only a test.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, a test is followed by a "Recap" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)</p>
<p>Chapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only <strong>"Create New Chapter"</strong> from a <strong><em>course</em></strong>. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous steps that there is now a <strong>"Create New Chapter"</strong> button at the top. </p>
<p>Click on that when you're ready to create your chapter.</p>
<p><img src="/img/create-new-chapter1.png"></p>
<h3 id="create-new-chapter-part-1">Create New Chapter - Part 1</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Create New Chapter</strong> menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):</p>
<p><a href="/img/create-chapter-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/create-chapter-1.png"></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Name</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the name of the chapter here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong><ul>
<li>You must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rank</strong><ul>
<li>The Rank is the order in which this chapter will display. The lower the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) the <em>higher</em> the chapter will be listed. Rank 1 = the very first chapter. Rank 999 = the very last chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Number of Test Questions</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that <strong>"pool"</strong> of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Pass Percentage</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: "<em>This chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your “Report Card.” Click START below when you are ready.</em>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the test summary for when the user passes the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Summary (Failed Test) (Seen upon test completion)</strong><ul>
<li>Enter the test summary for when the user fails the test. The default text is already populated if you do not need to change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Type</strong><ul>
<li>Your options here are: Standard, Survey, Only Test, No Test. More on testing mechanisms can be found <em>here</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pull Questions in Order By Rank</strong><ul>
<li>This will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fail Test on Incorrect</strong><ul>
<li>Setting this to "Yes" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Answer Notifications</strong><ul>
<li>Setting this to "Yes" will allow you to enter an email address <strong><em>per answer</em></strong> which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Test Stats</strong><ul>
<li>This toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Show Test Summary Nav Buttons</strong><ul>
<li>This toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enable Notes</strong><ul>
<li>This will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should <strong>always</strong> be set to "Yes" unless indicated otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong><ul>
<li>You can enter in social information <strong>per chapter</strong>, more information on that can be found <em>here</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chapter Part Info</strong><ul>
<li>You must enter at least "1" chapter part here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have filled out each field, hit <strong>Save</strong>, and there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.</p>

<li>Selecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Video Path</strong>: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Path</strong>: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Path</strong>: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rehash/Recap - Video Path</strong><ul>
<li>A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a <em>recap</em> before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Add Question</strong><ul>
