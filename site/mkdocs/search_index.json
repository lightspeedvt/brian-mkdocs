Chapter Overview\n\n\nOnce a user clicks into a Course, they may select a Chapter of their choice, unless you changed the toggle to require them to take the chapters in order.  \n\n\nA Course may have as many Chapters as needed. Each Chapter may consist of multiple Chapter parts. Each Chapter part may consist of any number of different media types: video, Flash SWF, PDF document, HTML, etc.. \n\n\nA Chapter may consist of...\n\n\n\n\nTraining parts and a Chapter test.\n\n\nTraining parts and no test.\n\n\nNo training parts and only a test.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a test is followed by a \"Recap\" Chapter part if the user fails to pass the test. (this is optional)\n\n\nChapter creation is unique from Categories and Courses in which you can only \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n from a \ncourse\n. So you'll see after you save your course from the previous steps that there is now a \n\"Create New Chapter\"\n button at the top. \n\n\nClick on that when you're ready to create your chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 1\n\n\nOn the \nCreate New Chapter\n menu, we see the following fields (click on the image to open it in a new window):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nEnter the name of the chapter here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nYou must add at least 1 test question in order for you to receive the option to activate the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nThe Rank is the order in which this chapter will display.

Rank 999 = the very last chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Test Questions\n\n\nEnter the number of test questions that will be pulled for this chapter. If you enter a number here smaller than the total number of test questions active, then it will randomly select that number from that \n\"pool\"\n of available questions. For example - if there are 10 active test questions for this chapter, and the number of test questions is set to 5, each time a user takes the test it will randomly serve up 5 of the 10 total questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Pass Percentage\n\n\nEnter the minimum test percentage a user must receive in order to pass the test and move on to the next chapter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Instructions / Setup (Seen before test)\n\n\nEnter the test instruction text the user will see before starting the test. The default language we use here is: \"\nThis chapter test is a quick check of your knowledge so far. As you select your answers, each question is timed and all results are recorded on your \u201cReport Card.\u201d Click START below when you are ready.\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Summary (Passed Test) (Seen upon test completion)\n\n\nEnter the test summary for when the user passes the test.

More on testing mechanisms can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull Questions in Order By Rank\n\n\nThis will pull all of the test questions in order by rank, and no longer serve them up randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFail Test on Incorrect\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will cause the user to fail the test on ANY missed question - rather than allowing them to complete the entire test first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Notifications\n\n\nSetting this to \"Yes\" will allow you to enter an email address \nper answer\n which will notify the recipient of that user's answer. This is often used with the Survey test type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Stats\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the test stats before and after the test. This is often used with the Survey test types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Test Summary Nav Buttons\n\n\nThis toggle will show or hide the navigation buttons after the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Notes\n\n\nThis will toggle on and off the notes feature for this specific chapter. Additionally you can control the notes feature at the Group level, and at the Course level. This should \nalways\n be set to \"Yes\" unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\nYou can enter in social information \nper chapter\n, more information on that can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Part Info\n\n\nYou must enter at least \"1\" chapter part here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have filled out each field, hit \nSave\n, and there will be some additional fields to complete before moving on.\n\n\nCreate New Chapter - Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Captions\n\n\nSelecting this button will show the optional Caption fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path\n\n\nVideo Path\n: This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)\n\n\nMobile Path\n: This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.\n\n\nAsset Path\n: This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRehash/Recap - Video Path\n\n\nA recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a \nrecap\n before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Question\n\n\nThis is where you can add test questions to this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        Note\n    \n\n    \n\nBe sure to hit \"Save\" before you hit \"Add Question\" - as you will lose any modifications you have made to the chapter if you do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all of the chapter information has been added, you're ready to move on to the next section - adding test questions.\n\n\n4.

Video Path, Mobile Path, Asset Path  Video Path : This is the path to the chapter part media (MP4, PDF, etc.)  Mobile Path : This is the path to the mobile encoded version of the above video path.  Asset Path : This is a legacy field, it is for content that still utilizes flash side assets that lay on top of the video parts, before they were edited into the video itself.    Rehash/Recap - Video Path  A recap HTML file is linked here by default. If the user fails the test then the user will be prompted to take a  recap  before taking the test again. This HTML file will let the user know they have 1 more chance to pass the test or else they'll have to watch the chapter part over again.
