<p>Each “System” currently has 12 access levels. Within the System, these Access Levels can be renamed to best suit your needs. Additionally, we will turn off any unused Access Levels for your System to alleviate any confusion.</p>
<p>The Access Levels are really organized into three tiers, which are:</p>
<p><strong>Super Users</strong></p>
<p>“Multi location admins” – which can access the “Super User” dashboard which is a series of reporting tools and Admin features over Multiple Locations.</p>
<p><strong>Managers</strong></p>
<p>“Location level admin” – which can access the “Quick Links” at the location level, which give them access to administrate users* and run training and usage reports. As you will see below, there are three levels of Managers, and if you grant the Manager the “Ability to Create Users” they can only create users at their access level or lower. Then cannot create users above their Access Level. The same rule goes for the “Super User C” – in that they cannot create a “Super User B.”</p>
<p><strong>Users</strong></p>
<p>This is a standard user who can access the Training Center and view their own reports.</p>
<h3 id="access-level-explanations">Access Level Explanations</h3>
<p>Below, is the specific numeric ID’s for the Access Levels (note: the names in parentheses are the default names that these start out as – we can rename them to suit your needs):</p>
<p><strong>Super Users:</strong></p>
<p>Access Level 1 (Super User A)<br />
This is reserved for LightSpeed VT Administrators to use on your account. No client access is provided on this level.</p>
<p>Access Level 2 (Super User B)<br />
This level is reserved for your “Top Client Admin” users that will need the most access all of the Admin features and over multiple locations.</p>
<p>Access Level 3 (Super User C)<br />
This level is commonly used to provide access for your clients that need to have reporting and access to multiple locations. Note, the “Super User B” has the privileges to determine what locations each “Super User C” can access, allowing for you as the “Top Client Admin” to set their privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Managers</strong></p>
<p>Access Level 4 (Manager A)
Access Level 5 (Manager B)
Access Level 6 (Manager C)</p>
<p>Users
Access Level 7 (User A)
Access Level 8 (User B)
Access Level 9 (User C)
Access Level 10 (Limited User A)
Access Level 11 (Limited User B)
Access Level 12 (Limited User C)</p>
<p>Reporting Needs
It is possible to utilize our “Job Positions” and “Teams” to further organize users into other designations. Job Positions are “System” centric labels, and “Teams” are “Location” level names (click on each label below see their related article).</p>
<p>Using the Job Positions Feature
Using the Teams Feature
Common Configurations
Take, for example,  a fictitious training company called “Acme Training Company” that has one corporate office, as well as offices in different cities with Managers and Users at each Location. See the example below for a possible way to set up Access Levels for this “Acme Training Company”.</p>
<p>Access Level 2 (Super User B) – [ACME Training Admin]
This will be for users at the Corporate office that will be overseeing the entire organization.
Access Level 3 (Super User C) – [ACME Regional Manager]
This will be a user that works at one of the field offices, but still needs admin and reporting access over the locations that they specifically oversee – such as the “South West Region.”
Access Level 4 (Manager A) – [General Manager]
This will be the GM of a specific location and will oversee the users only at their own location.
Access Level 5 (Manager B) – [Assistant Manager]
This is a lower level manager that can run reports on all of the users at their specific location, but cannot administrate users above them.
Access Level 6
(NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE)
Access Level 7 (User A) – [Sales Associate]
This is a user that has Sales training provisioned to their access level, and can utilize all of that training and run their own reports.
Access Level 8 (User B) – [Front Desk Attendant]
This is a user that has Front Desk training provisioned to their access level, and can utilize all of that training and run their own reports.
Access Level 9

Access Level 10
